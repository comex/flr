Rule 101/7 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absence of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to initiate a formal process to
            resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable
            expectation that the controversy will thereby be resolved.
            Every person has the right to cause formal reconsideration
            of any judicial determination that e should be punished.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player has the right to deregister rather than
            continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825 (called 7 November 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if
no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1709 (called 26 July 2007): The rules are binding on all those
who play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they
have the rule-defined status of "player".]

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1488 (called 11 February 2004): Engineering a situation in which
other players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself
a violation of that rule.]

[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): The right of participation in the
fora is the right to participate in them for their intended purposes,
and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner
and type of participation.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): An obligation on a player to not
publish statements that e believes are true would conflict with the
right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1753 (called 28 September 2007): The right to cease playing
applies only to those who have the rule-defined status of "player",
not to those who play the game in the broader sense without having
that official status.]

Rule 2125/1 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if:

      (a) the action is prohibited;

      (b) the rules indicate that if certain conditions are satisfied,
          then some player is permitted to perform the action;

      (c) the action would, as part of its effect, modify information
          for which some player is required to be a recordkeepor; or

      (d) the action would, as part of its effect, make it impossible
          to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
          combinations of actions by players.

Rule 1586/3 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      Two Rule-defined entities CANNOT have the same name or nickname.

      If the Rules defining an entity are repealed or amended such
      that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
      properties cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they still
      define that entity but with different properties, then that
      entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever extent
      is possible under the new definitions.

Rule 1688/4 (Power=3)
Power

      The power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
      An instrument is an entity with positive power.

      The power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the rules.  All entities have power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      A rule that secures a change (hereafter the securing rule)
      thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that change except as
      allowed by an instrument with power greater than or equal to the
      change's power threshold.  This threshold defaults to the
      securing rule's power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      rule.

Rule 2140/0 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can

      (a) cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

      (b) adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than
          its own.

      (c) modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with
          power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
          an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
          operation.

Rule 2149/8 (Power=1)
Truthfulness

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement unless e believes
      that in doing so e is telling the truth.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.

[CFJ 1739 (called 29 August 2007): A quotation can result in a
violation of rule 2149, depending on the context of the rest of the
message.]

Rule 2110/2 (Power=3)
Win by Paradox

      If an inquiry case on the possibility of a rule-defined action
      or the permissibility of an action results in a judgement of
      UNDECIDABLE, and that judgement is not appealed within a week,
      then the initiator of the inquiry case wins the game if e is a
      player.  This can only occur once per inquiry case.

Rules

      processes of changing the rules.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2141/1 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern
      the game generally.  A rule's content takes the form of
      a text, and is unlimited in scope.  In particular, a rule
      may define in-game entities and regulate their behaviour,
      make instantaneous changes to the state of in-game entities,
      prescribe or proscribe certain player behaviour, modify the
      rules or the application thereof, or do any of these things
      in a conditional manner.

      Every rule has power between one and four inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor shall assign
      a title to it by announcement as soon as possible.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.

[CFJ 1498 (called 12 April 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a
name for the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the
uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.]

Rule 217/6 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

[CFJ 1139: Interpretations [judgements at the time of CFJ 1139] need
not necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
Justices given in past CFJs.]

Rule 1482/2 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule
      to stipulate any other means of determining precedence
      between Rules of unequal Power.  This applies to changes by
      the enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit
      such a change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1103 (called 18 August 1998): In the case of conflict between
Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer to the
lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes precedence
over Rule 1482.]

[CFJ 858 (called 15 February 1996): If a low-Power [low-MI at the time
of Judgement of CFJ 858] Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule
of higher Power to mean something other than its ordinary English
meaning, that may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does
must be decided on a case-by-case basis.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/6 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower ID number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence-determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Rule 105/3 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The ID number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument; any
          attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes
      that change to be void and without effect.  A variation in
      whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of an existing
      rule does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this
      rule, but any other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 1499 (called 20 April 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 1 April 2007): If a
low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is different
from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal itself.]

[CFJ 708 (called October 1994): An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is
not a legal Rule Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

Rule 1681/11 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
      of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
      mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
      changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
      proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/25 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A person CAN register, unless prevented by the rules, by
      announcing that e registers, wishes to register, requests
      registration, or requests permission to register.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement.  E CANNOT register
      within thirty days after doing so.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

Rule 2139/1 (Power=1)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each player:

      a) Information sufficient to identify and contact em.
      b) The date on which e most recently became a player.

[CFJ 1703 (called 13 July 2007): A player cannot change eir nickname
by announcement if the new nickname that e specifies is the current
nickname of another player.]

[CFJ 1361 (called 7 May 2002): Purporting to assign a new nickname,
previously unused to refer to any entity, to another player is
successful, but does not displace the target's existing name or
nickname.]

[CFJ 1489 (called 11 February 2004): Watchers are not a rule-defined
element of the game.]

[CFJ 1420 (called 17 December 2002): The list of watchers, customarily
published with the registrar's report, is part of the game state, even
though it is not mentioned in the rules and no one is obliged to track
or publish it.]

[Cross-references (7 November 2007): the Registrar's duties are:
  * track citizenship (rule 869)
  * report players' identity and contact details (rule 2139)
  * report registration dates (rule 2139)
  * report deregistration by Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)

Rule 1789/3 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

[CFJ 1594 (called 16 December 2006): Players can be deregistered due
to this rule even if there is no Registrar.]

Activity

      Activity is a player switch with values Active (default) and

      includes the date on which each non-Active player's activity
      last changed.

      A player CAN flip eir activity by announcement.  "To go on hold"
      is to become Inactive; "to come off hold" is to become Active.

      A player CAN flip another player's activity to Inactive without
      objection.

      A player who has been continuously Inactive for at least three
      months CAN be deregistered by any other player without
      objection.

Rule 478/22 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that No Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each forum with non-Foreign
      publicity, sufficient instructions for players to receive
      messages there.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A player "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a player performs that action by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

[CFJs 1451-1452 (called 6 March 2003): A message that is split into
multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct the
single message.]

[CFJ 752 (called 13 March 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813 (called 22 October 1995): A Player need not prove that e can
receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831 (called 10 November 1995): The Date: header of a message is
not necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 866 (called 8 April 1996): A message is "received" when the
message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1314 (called 15 August 2001): If a message sent to a public forum
is rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
sent via a public forum.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1784 (called 5 November 2007): An undescriptive or misleading
subject line does not deprive the message body of effect.]

[CFJ 1761 (called 30 September 2007): Publishing part of a message is
a different action from publishing the whole message.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1719 (called 12 August 2007): A player can, if e intends, have
public messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that
allows all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific
approval.]

[CFJ 1336 (called 13 December 2001): A public statement that one
wishes to perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
constitute an announcement that performs that action.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

[CFJ 1584 (called 24 February 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 August 2007):
Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of instances
of "I do X".]

[CFJ 1774 (called 1 November 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where
X is something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
abusive.  The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
successful.]

[CFJ 1775 (called 1 November 2007): If an announcement of the form "I
do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do
X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have
the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
M.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): An appropriate announcement will
accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
impossible.]

Rule 754/7 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning, as do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly
          defined by the rules.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 1439 (called 20 February 2003): A difference in language

sufficiently clear synonym for "Me too!".]

rule-defined term in its own way, and the contract's definition will
then apply in situations governed by the contract.]

Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
      a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
      precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
      players in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
      the specified player(s).

         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it

Rule 1023/22 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrase "as soon as possible" means "within seven days".

      (b) The term "paragraph" means a subset of text determined as
          follows:

          (1) Each bulleted or enumerated (hereafter simply
              "bulleted") section is a unit of text.

          (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

          (3) Each unit of a document has a level as follows.  All
              unbulleted units have level 1.  Each bulleted unit has
              level n+2, where n is the number of bulleted units it is
              nested inside.

          (4) A barrier between two units is a unit appearing between
              those units which has level no greater than that of the
              unit appearing first.

          (5) The units of a document form an ordered tree, with the
              hierarchy determined as follows.  The root is an empty
              unit with level zero, which nominally appears at the
              beginning of the document.  One unit is a descendant of
              another unit if it appears after the latter, has
              strictly greater level, and is not separated from the
              latter by a barrier.  The tree's ordering follows the
              order of the units in the document.

          (6) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
              determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
              entirety of that quotation.

          (7) A "paragraph" identified by an ordinal n is determined
              by the nth unbulleted unit and its descendants.

          (8) A "paragraph" identified by enumerated section labels is
              determined by the sub-tree arrived at by traversal from
              the root, using the specified series of labels.

      (c) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

Rule 2161/2 (Power=2)
ID Numbers

      If a rule defines a type of entity as having ID numbers, then:

      (a) Whenever an instance of that type does not have an ID
          number, the player held responsible by that rule SHALL
          assign an ID number to it by announcement as soon as
          possible.

      (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
          number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
          digits) distinct from any ID number, and greater than any
          orderly ID number, previously assigned to an entity of that
          type.  The player SHALL select the smallest number possible,
          unless e reasonably believes that selecting any smaller
          number might be invalid or confusing.

      (c) Each ID number is either orderly (default) or chaotic.  Upon
          a judicial finding that the assignment of an ID number was
          ILLEGAL, the ID number becomes chaotic.

      (d) Once assigned, an ID number cannot be changed.

      (e) If an office is responsible for assigning ID numbers, then
          that officer's report includes the greatest orderly ID
          number, and a list of all chaotic ID numbers, previously
          assigned to the type of entity.

Indices

      Indices are elements of the extended real numbers, which is a
      total order consisting of the real numbers plus a minimum
      element, called negative infinity, and a maximum element, called
      positive infinity or unanimity.

      The ratio of a positive index to zero is positive infinity.  The
      ratio of a negative index to zero is negative infinity.  The
      ratio of zero to any index is zero.

Rule 2162/1 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes the value of each instance of
         that switch whose value is not its default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

Rule 2150/1 (Power=2)
Personhood

      A person is an entity that has the general capacity to be the
      subject of rights and obligations under the rules.  An entity is
      a person if and only if it is defined to be so by rules with
      power 2 or greater.

      Any biological organism that is capable of communicating by
      email in English is a person.

      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.

[CFJ 1700 (called 10 July 2007): The requirement of capability to
communicate by email can be satisfied even if the players of Agora do
not know the organism's email address.]

[CFJ 1685 (called 31 May 2007): Being in a mindless job (e.g.,
keyboard, stenographer, spokesman) may create a rebuttable presumption
against personhood and against one having spoken on one's own behalf.]

Rule 2166/1 (Power=2)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document).

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Bank.  If an asset's backing
      document restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then
      that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
      outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity
      outside that class.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
      such by its backing document.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
      portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying.

      An asset generally CAN be created by its recordkeepor by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing document.
      To "gain" an asset is to have it created in one's possession; to
      "award" an asset to an entity is to create it in that entity's
      possession.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
      announcement, and an asset owned by the Bank generally CAN be
      destroyed by its recordkeepor by announcement, subject to
      modification by its backing document.  To "lose" an asset is to
      have it destroyed from one's possession; to "revoke" an asset
      from an entity is to destroy it from that entity's possession.

      A asset generally CAN be transferred by its owner to another
      entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document.  Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): The self-ratifying asset
report is the complete list of ownerships of assets of that class; a
partial list does not self-ratify.]

Rule 1728/16 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An announcement of intent to perform a dependent action,
      unambiguously describing the action and method of dependent
      action, initiates the Agoran decision of whether to approve the
      action.  For this decision:

      (a) The vote collector is the announcer.

      (b) The available options are SUPPORT and OBJECT.

      (c) The voting period ends after fourteen days or immediately
          before it is resolved, whichever comes first.

      (d) The eligible voters are those entities that were active
          first-class players at the start of the voting period,
          except for the vote collector, and any entities disqualified
          by the rule specifying that the action can be performed
          dependently.

      (e) The voting limit of each eligible voter is one.

      (f) The vote collector of such a decision CANNOT resolve it if
          it was initiated more than fourteen days ago, or (if it has
          an objection and/or majority index) less than four days ago.

      (g) If the outcome is APPROVED, then the vote collector performs
          the action upon resolving the decision.

      The specification in the rules that an action can be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): The method of dependent action need
not be described exactly: an approximate but inexact description
suffices, as does the rule-defined term.]

Rule 1769/5 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The registration of a player is an
event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1480 (called 5 January 2004): An automatic event specified to
occur at regular calendar intervals, for example quarterly, happens at
its specified time even if that is during a holiday.]

Rule 2154/4 (Power=2)
Replacing Officers

      Any player CAN make an active player (hereafter the nominee) the
      holder of an office, thus removing any previous holder from the
      office, with Agoran Consent, provided that the nominee consents
      to hold the office after the announcement of intent is made.

      If intent to achieve consent for a nominee is announced as
      above, then any other active player may be nominated for the
      position with eir own consent by announcement, during the
      minimum waiting period between intent and action defined for
      Agoran Consent.

      If, at the end of this period, there is more than one consenting
      nominee, then officeholding cannot be changed by means of this
      Agoran consent (even if consent was achieved), and the IADoP
      SHALL as soon as possible initiate an Agoran decision to
      determine the new officeholder.  Until this Agoran decision is
      resolved, the office cannot change hands by the mechanism of
      this rule.

      In the Agoran decision to determine a new officeholder, the
      valid options are the nominees, quorum is the lesser of three
      and the number of active players (other rules on quorum
      notwithstanding), the eligible voters are the active players,
      and the vote collector is the IADoP.  In the notice resolving
      the decision, the IADoP will select one nominee from the set of
      nominees which each received the largest number of votes; this
      chosen nominee becomes the officeholder upon the posting of the
      valid notice.

      Stability is an office switch, tracked by the IADoP, with values
      Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN flip an
      office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual office
      becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no attempt
      to change the holder of that office with Agoran consent was made
      during that quarter, then the IADoP SHALL make at least one such
      attempt in the following quarter, and SHALL make the change if
      consent is achieved.  These requirements are waived if another
      player makes such a change during the following quarter.

      The IADoP's report includes the following:

      a) The holder of each office.

Official Reports

      For each office:

      a) If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         office's weekly report, then the holder of that office SHALL
         maintain all such information, and SHALL publish it at least
         once each week.  Otherwise, that office has no weekly report.

      b) If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         office's monthly report, then the holder of that office SHALL
         maintain all such information, and SHALL publish it at least
         once each month.  Otherwise, that office has no monthly
         report.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of an office's

Rule 1551/10 (Power=3)
Ratification

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      An official document is a public document purported to be part
      (possibly all) of an official report; this part is the
      document's scope.  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify an
      official document, specifying its scope.  The date of this
      ratification and the scope of the ratified document become part
      of the official report in question, until the same scope is
      ratified at a later date.

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly
      challenged during that period.

      When a public document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so
      that the ratified document was completely true and accurate at
      the time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      public document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel
      any messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or
      overlooked, or change the legality of any attempted action.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying
document [at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran
decision] must explicitly identify the document, either individually
or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some
aspect of it.]

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): A challenge to any part of
a self-ratifying document prevents ratification of all parts of it.]

Deputisation

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if:

      (a) the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
          office is vacant, would so require if the office were
          filled); and

      (b) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired; and

      (c) the deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier
          that e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes
          of the particular action; and

      (d) it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

[CFJ 1776 (called 1 November 2007): A requirement to perform an
action, for the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication
from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules.]

Rule 107/6 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) A clear indication of the options available.

      (d) The identity of the vote collector.

      (e) Any additional information required by the rules for this
          announcement.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days, unless the decision is whether to approve a
      dependent action.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
the information required in the notice need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1743 (called 18 September 2007): If the notice does not mention
voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the
rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
describes the class of eligible voters.]

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): Information that is explicitly
presented in the notice takes precedence over any information that
would be implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate
and the implicit information would have been accurate.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 683/14 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision, and the submitter is an eligible voter at the
          time of submission.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

      Among the otherwise-valid votes on an Agoran decision, only the
      first N submitted by each entity are valid, where N is the
      entity's voting limit on that decision.  The voting limit of an
      entity that is not an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is
      zero.  The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
      decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

      this has not already happened for the decision in question.

Resolving Agoran decisions

      SHALL do so as soon as possible after the end of the voting
      period.  To be valid, this announcement must satisfy the
      following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

[CFJ 1711 (called 1 August 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers to a previous notice with an incomplete vote tally and lists
additional votes but does not give revised totals, this does not

Rule 955/11 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      The outcome of an Agoran decision is determined as follows.

      (a) If there is more than one available option, and the number
          of distinct voters who submitted valid ballots is less than
          quorum, then the outcome is FAILED QUORUM, regardless of the
          remainder of this rule.  Otherwise, the decision achieved
          quorum.

      (b) If the decision is whether to adopt a proposal, then the
          voting index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to the
          strength of AGAINST.  If the voting index is greater than 1,
          and greater than or equal to the decision's adoption index,
          then the outcome is ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is
          REJECTED.

      (d) If the decision is whether to approve a dependent action:

          (1) If the strength of OBJECT is greater than or equal to
              the objection index (if any), then the outcome is
              REJECTED.

          (2) If the strength of SUPPORT is less than the support
              index (if any), then the outcome is REJECTED.

          (3) If the ratio of the strength of SUPPORT to the combined
              strength of SUPPORT and OBJECT is less than or equal to
              the majority index (if any), then the outcome is
              REJECTED.

          (4) Otherwise, the outcome is APPROVED.

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is
determined at the time the vote collector makes the calculations

Rule 2034/4 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
      existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is
      wholly without effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      This does not prevent amendment of the rules governing the
      validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
      changed in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
      does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

      A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.

======================================================================
Proposals
      A category concerning the primary and plenipotent system by
      which changes are made to the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/8 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The proposer of a
      proposal may remove it from the Pool by announcement.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
      PRESENT, and the adoption index is the adoption index of the
      proposal.

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1,
      with a minimum value of 1.0.  It may be set by the proposer at
      the time of submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.  A
      Proposal with an Adoption Index of less than 2 is Ordinary.  All
      other Proposals are Democratic.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
      which would permit a proposal to take effect.

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1717 (called 8 August 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient
to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.]

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

[CFJ 1781 (called 4 November 2007): Proposal distribution is not
governed by this rule, so for the promotor to distribute a proposal
that is not in the proposal pool is not a violation of this rule.]

Rule 2153/1 (Power=1)
Interest Index

      The interest index of a proposal is an integer from 0 to 3.  It
      CAN be set by the proposer at the time of submission, or
      otherwise defaults to 1.  A proposal's interest index SHOULD be
      proportional to its complexity.

      "Disinterested" is a synonym for "interest index 0".  A proposal
      SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects are limited
      to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

Rule 1607/15 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal Pool at
      any time.  During each week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool since the beginning
      of that week.

      The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

      When distributing a proposal, the Promotor SHALL specify the
      following:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its adoption index.
      c) Whether it is ordinary or democratic.
      d) Whether it is interested or disinterested.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.

[CFJ 1546 (called 14 April 2005), CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a
proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted
proposal if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of
the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal distribution
of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor creates a new
proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a
proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential
differences), then the author of the new proposal is the author of the
proposal on which it is based.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor accidentally
creates a new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is
seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
proposal has no author.]

[Cross-references (2 August 2007): the Promotor's duties are:
  * not distribute proposals during holiday (rule 1769)
  * distribute proposals (rule 1607)
  * manage ID numbers of distributed proposals (rule 1607)
  * report proposal pool (rule 1607)]

Rule 2156/3 (Power=2)
Voting on Ordinary Proposals

      Each player has a parameter known as eir base voting limit on
      ordinary proposals (BVLOP).  The BVLOP of a first-class player
      is four, and the BVLOP of any other player is zero.  BVLOP
      cannot be modified.

      Each player has a parameter known as eir volatile voting limit
      on ordinary proposals (VVLOP).  Whenever a player is registered,
      eir VVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.  Changes to VVLOP are secured

      Each player has a parameter known as eir effective voting limit
      on ordinary proposals (EVLOP).  Whenever a player is registered,
      eir EVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.  At the end of each week, each
      player's EVLOP is set to eir VVLOP, rounded to an integer,
      breaking ties towards odd integers, and eir VVLOP is set to the
      same rounded value.  EVLOP cannot be modified by any other
      means.  The assessor's report includes each player's EVLOP.

      The eligible voters on an ordinary proposal are those entities
      that were active players at the start of its voting period.  The
      voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary proposal is eir
      EVLOP at the start of its voting period, or half that (rounded
      up) if the voter is in the chokey at the start of the voting
      period.

Rule 2126/39 (Power=2)
Voting Credits

      Voting Credits (VCs) are a class of fixed assets that can be
      used to affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  Changes to
      VC holdings are secured.  Ownership of VCs is restricted to
      players.

      Each VC has exactly one color.  Colors with different names are
      distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of VC is
      a currency.  If a player is meant to lose a VC of a color that e
      does not possess, then e loses a VC of eir Party's color
      instead; if e has no VCs at all, then the loss is waived (you
      can't get blood from a turnip).

      The Assessor is the recordkeepor of VCs.

      VCs are gained and lost as follows:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted, its proposer gains
           a number of Red VCs equal to the proposal's adoption index
           times its interest index (rounded down to the nearest
           integer), minus the number of Red VCs that e has gained in
           this way earlier in the same week (down to a minimum of
           zero), and each coauthor named in the proposal gains one
           Red VC unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in the same
           week.

      (-R) When a proposal's voting index is less than half its
           adoption index, its proposer loses one Red VC, unless e
           lost a VC in this way earlier in the same week.

      (+O) When an interested proposal is adopted by voting with no
           valid votes AGAINST, its proposer gains one orange VC
           unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in the same week.

      (-O) When an interested proposal is rejected by voting with no
           valid votes FOR, and having met quorum, its proposer loses
           one orange VC, unless e lost a VC in this way earlier in
           the same week.

      (+G) At the end of each month, for each office with a report,
           the player (if any) who held that office for the majority
           of that month gains two Green VCs (if the office has a
           weekly report) or one Green VC (if it has only a monthly
           report), unless another person deputised for that office
           while that player held that office during that month.

      (-G) At the end of each month, for each office, for each player
           who has held that office during that month, if another
           person deputised for that office while that player held
           that office during that month then that player loses one
           Green VC.

      (+C) When a player deputises for an office e gains one cyan VC,
           unless someone previously gained a VC in this manner for
           the same office in the same month.

      (+B) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question
           other than a question on sentencing, and has not violated a
           requirement to submit that judgement within a time limit, e
           gains one blue VC.

      (-B) A player who is recused from a judicial case with cause
           loses one Blue VC.  A player who is the prior judge in an
           appeal case where a judgement other than AFFIRM is assigned
           to the question on disposition loses one Blue VC.

      (+K) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question on
           sentencing, and has not violated a requirement to submit
           that judgement within a time limit, e gains one black VC.

      (-K) In a criminal case, when a sentence becomes active for the
           first time the defendant loses one black VC.

      (+W) When a first-class person becomes a player and has never
           been a player before, e gains one white VC.  When a
           first-class person has been a player continuously for 100
           days and has never been a player before that period, e
           gains one white VC.

      (+M) When, during Agora's birthday, a player publicly
           acknowledges the occasion, e gains one magenta VC, unless e
           previously gained a VC in this manner during the same
           birthday.

      (+U) When a player wins the game, e gains two ultraviolet VCs.

      (+V) When a person is awarded a patent title, e gains one violet
           VC, unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in the same
           month.

      (-V) When a person has a patent title revoked from em, and the
           instrument that authorises the revocation does not describe
           the revocation as administrative, e loses one violet VC.

      (+I) When a person is awarded a patent title that is a degree, e
           gains a number of indigo VCs.  The number depends on the
           rank of the degree: it is two for the lowest rank, four for
           the next, and so on increasing by two per rank, up to a
           maximum of twelve for the sixth and higher ranks.  If the
           rank of the degree is not adequately defined to apply this
           rule then the number is two.

      (-*) One second before the end of each month, each entity loses
           1/5 of eir holdings of each color of VC, rounded down to
           the nearest integer.

      (+Y) At the end of each month, for each contest that awarded
           points to at least three different contestants during that
           month, the contestmaster gains one Yellow VC.

      VCs may be spent as follows, by announcement (INVALID unless the
      color is specified):

      a) A player may spend N+1 VCs of different colors to increase
         another player's VVLOP by N, where N >= 1.

      b) A player may spend N+2 VCs of different colors to increase
         eir own VVLOP by N, where N >= 1.

      c) A player may spend N+1 VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by N (to a minimum of zero).

      d) A player may spend N+2 VCs of different colors to multiply
         another player's VVLOP by (10-N)/10, where 1 <= N <= 10.

      e) A player may spend two VCs of the same color to make another
         player gain one VC of that color.

      z) If this rule mentions at least six different specific colors
         for VCs, a player may spend one VC of each such color to win
         the game.

      When a game win occurs, each player's VVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.

Adjudication
      A category concerning the judicial system by which matters of
      controversy are resolved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/9 (Power=2)
Judicial Cases Generally

      A judicial case, also known as a call for judgement (CFJ), is a
      procedure to settle a matter of controversy.  There are
      subclasses of judicial case with particular features defined by
      other rules.  Subclasses of judicial case exist only as defined
      by the rules.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office, responsible for
      managing judicial activity.  The CotC's report includes the
      status of all judicial cases that either require a judge or have
      at least one applicable judicial question that has no judgement.

      Judicial cases other than appeal cases have ID numbers, to be
      assigned by the Clerk of the Courts.

[CFJs 1756-1757 (called 28 September 2007): A CFJ cannot belong to
more than one subclass.  An announcement claiming to initiate a CFJ of
more than one subclass does not initiate any CFJ.]

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[CFJ 1355 (called 28 April 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so
it is possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.]

[CFJ 1742 (called 13 September 2007): A judicial case can exist that
has no subclass.]

[Cross-references (7 November 2007): the Clerk of the Courts' duties
are:
  * issue Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * not assign judges during holiday (rule 1769)
  * prefer judicial panels containing the Default Justice (rule 2019)
  * report open judicial cases (rule 991)
  * manage ID numbers of non-appeal judicial cases (rule 991)
  * refuse excess CFJ (rule 2175)
  * assign judge to judicial case (rule 1868)
  * track player posture (rule 1871)
  * track player hawkishness (rule 1871)
  * change all sitting players to standing (rule 1871)
  * push over recused judge (rule 1871)
  * recuse tardy judge (rule 2158)
  * inform defendant in criminal case (rule 1504)
  * report active sentences (rule 1504)]

Excess CFJs

      A judicial case initiated by a person who has previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same Agoran Week as that
      case is an Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the Courts CAN, by
      announcement, refuse an Excess CFJ that has not had any judge
      assigned to it.  Refusal of an Excess CFJ causes it to cease to
      be a judicial case.

Rule 1868/11 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge;
      this is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.  To recuse a judge from a case means to deassign em as
      judge.  To assign a judge to a case implicitly recuses any
      existing judge.  A recusal is with cause if and only if stated
      as such by the rules.

      At any time, a judicial case either does not require a judge
      (default) or requires a judge; this is not a persistent status,
      but is evaluated instantaneously.

      When a judicial case requires a judge and has no judge assigned,
      the CotC CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by
      announcement.  Whenever this situation arises the CotC SHALL
      make such an assignment as soon as possible.

      Except where modified by other rules, the entities qualified to
      be assigned as judge of a judicial case are the active
      first-class players.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a
      judge does not inherently prevent an entity from continuing to
      be judge if already assigned.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is
      still the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from
      that case by announcement.

      Making an entity unqualified or poorly qualified to judge is
      secured, with a power threshold of 1.5.

[CFJ 1186: The Clerk of the Courts is required by Rule 1868 to select
a Judge who is qualified ["eligible" at the time of CFJ 1186] at the
time that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
qualified at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced.]

Rule 1871/20 (Power=1.5)
The Standing Court

      Posture is a player switch with values Standing, Sitting,
      Leaning, and Supine (default), tracked by the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value
      by announcement.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  A sitting or leaning player is poorly qualified
      to be assigned as judge of any judicial case.

      Hawkishness is a player switch with values Hanging, Hugging, and
      Hemming-and-Hawing (default), tracked by the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A player CAN flip eir hawkishness by announcement.

      A hanging player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      inquiry case.  A hugging player is unqualified to be assigned as
      judge of any criminal case, and poorly qualified to be assigned
      as judge of any equity case.

      When the CotC assigns a standing player as judge of a judicial
      case, the player becomes sitting, except in the situation
      discussed in the next sentence.  If the CotC assigns a standing
      player as judge of more than one judicial case consecutively in
      the same announcement, and states in the announcement that these
      are linked assignments, the player becomes sitting upon the last
      of these assignments, but not any of the earlier ones.  The CotC
      SHOULD NOT perform linked assignments unless the cases being
      linked are closely related in their subject matter.

      The CotC CAN change all sitting players to standing by
      announcement.  The CotC SHALL NOT do this unless there is a
      judicial case to which e is obliged to assign a judge, all
      entities qualified to be so assigned are poorly qualified, and e
      immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns a
      judge to that case.

      When the CotC recuses a judge with cause, e SHALL flip that
      player's posture to supine by announcement within one week.

[CFJ 1765 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, this rule makes em capable of doing
so.]

[CFJ 1766 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, eir capability to do so exists as
long as the obligation does, and this obligation does not terminate
due to the one-week time limit running out.]

Rule 2157/1 (Power=1.7)
Judicial Panels

      A judicial panel is a structure whereby a group of two or more
      persons (its members) act together for the purpose of judging
      judicial cases.  A judicial panel's membership cannot change,
      and if two panels have the same membership then they are the
      same panel.  Judicial panels exist implicitly, without any
      specific act of formation.

      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous agreement of the panel's members, or with the
      majority agreement of the members and the consent of the CotC.
      By this mechanism a judicial panel can act, in situations where
      the rules state that an action is performed by sending a
      message.  A judicial panel can incur obligations.  The members
      of a panel SHALL act collectively to ensure that the panel
      satisfies all of its obligations.

[CFJ 1746 (called 21 September 2007): A judicial panel is not a
person.]

[CFJ 1767 (called 21 October 2007): The agreement of the panel's
members referred to in this rule is a state of affairs that does not
require public messages in order to be brought into being.]

Rule 2158/1 (Power=2)
Judicial Questions

      Within a judicial case, one or more judicial questions may
      arise.  Each judicial question is either inapplicable (default)
      or applicable; this is not a persistent status but is evaluated
      instantaneously.  Each judicial question either is open
      (default), suspended, or has a particular judgement; this is a
      persistent status that changes only according to the rules.  The
      possible types of judgement for a judicial question vary
      according to the type of question.

      When a judicial case has an applicable open judicial question,
      it requires a judge, and its judge CAN assign a valid judgement
      to that question by announcement.  Whenever there is a judge
      assigned to a judicial case with an applicable open question,
      the judge SHALL assign such a judgement to the question as soon
      as possible.

      Whenever a judicial case has a judicial question that has
      remained applicable and open, while the same judge has been
      assigned to the case, continuously for the past week, the CotC
      CAN recuse that judge with cause by announcement.  Whenever a
      judicial case has a judicial question that has remained
      applicable and open, while the same judge has been assigned to
      the case, continuously for the past two weeks, the CotC SHALL so
      recuse the judge as soon as possible.

      Among the possible judgements of a judicial question, some
      subset of them are appropriate.  Judgements are appropriate only
      where so defined by the rules.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an
      inappropriate judgement.  Where more than one appropriate
      judgement is available, the choice between them is at the
      judge's discretion.

      time by announcement.  If e has been assigned to the case for at
      least four days, such a recusal is with cause.

      Judicial cases can generally be transferred between judges by
      this procedure: an entity (the transferee) CAN assign emself as
      the judge of a judicial case by announcement if:

      (a) the case has a judge assigned (the transferor); and

      (b) the transferor and the transferee are different entities;
          and

      (c) the transferor has previously publicly consented to the
          transfer and not publicly withdrawn that consent; and

      (d) the transferee is qualified to be assigned as judge of the
          case; and

      (e) the transferee immediately (in the same announcement)
          assigns a judgement to a judicial question in the case.

Rule 591/20 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an inquiry case.
      An inquiry case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a
      particular statement.  An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any
      person, by announcement which includes the statement to be
      inquired into.

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable, nonsensical, too vague, or otherwise not capable
        of being accurately described as either false or true, at the
        time the inquiry case was initiated

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement at
        the time the inquiry case was initiated is not relevant to the
        game

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE,
        and UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however,
        uncertainty as to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot
        constitute insufficiency of information for this purpose

      The judgement of the question in an inquiry case SHOULD guide
      future play, including future judgements, but does not directly
      affect the veracity of the statement.  The rulekeepor is
      ENCOURAGED to annotate rules to draw attention to relevant
      inquiry case judgements.

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public
knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine
it.]

[CFJ 1482 (called 10 February 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement
logically depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called
CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this
as a situation of insufficient information being available.]

[CFJ 1744 (called 18 September 2007): It is not the job of the judge
to hunt down or request the information that would be required to
render a substantive judgement.]

[CFJ 1771 (called 28 October 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around
the interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is entitled
to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
available.]

[CFJ 1732 (called 23 August 2007): If a particular player holds a
particular office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player
holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that
office.]

Rule 1504/16 (Power=1.7)
Criminal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as a criminal case.
      A criminal case's purpose is to determine the culpability of a
      particular person, known as the defendant, for an alleged breach
      of the rules, and to punish the guilty.  A criminal case CAN be
      initiated by any player, by announcement which clearly specifies
      all of the following:

      a) The identity of the defendant.

      b) Exactly one rule allegedly breached by the defendant.

      c) The action (which may be a failure to perform another action)
         by which the defendant allegedly breached this rule.

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      In the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL as soon as possible inform
      the defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument
      for eir guilt.  The pre-trial phase ends one week after the
      defendant has been so informed.  At any time during the
      pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN end the pre-trial phase by
      announcement.

      The initiator and defendant are each unqualified to be assigned
      as judge of the case.  During the pre-trial phase, the defendant
      CAN disqualify one person from assignment as judge of the case,
      by announcement.  If e disqualifies the judge, then the judge is
      recused.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on culpability, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are:

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated

      * ALREADY TRIED, appropriate if judgement has already been
        reached in another criminal case with the same defendant, the
        same rule, and substantially the same alleged act

      * UNIMPUGNED, appropriate if the alleged act was not proscribed
        by the specified rule at the time it allegedly occurred

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act

      * SLIPPERY, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine beyond a reasonable doubt
        whether or not the defendant performed the alleged act

      * EXCUSED, appropriate if the defendant has good reason why e
        could not avoid breaching the rules in a manner at least as
        serious as alleged

      * GUILTY, appropriate if none of the above judgements is
        appropriate

      A criminal case has a judicial question on sentencing, which is
      applicable if the question on culpability is applicable and has
      a judgement of GUILTY.  If a criminal case has an applicable
      question on sentencing which has a judgement, the defendant is
      hereafter known as the ninny, the judgement in the question on
      sentencing is known as the sentence, and the sentence is in
      effect.

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      thereafter either active or not.  The sentence is inactive for
      the first week after it first takes effect.  Thereafter, the
      sentence is active if and only if it is still in effect and
      sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
      have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.  The
      CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.

      The valid sentences are:

      * DISCHARGE, appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances, if
        any available non-null punishment would be manifestly unjust.
        Has no effect.

      * APOLOGY with a set of up to ten words (the prescribed words),
        appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.  When in
        effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours publish a formal
        apology of at least 200 words, including all the prescribed
        words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
        for self-improvement.  The ninny is only obliged to publish
        one apology per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
        this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
        than once.

      * CHOKEY with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied
        by the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for rule breaches of
        intermediate severity.  While a sentence of this type is
        active, the ninny is in the chokey.  No entity is in the
        chokey except as required by this rule.

      * EXILE with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied by
        the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for severe rule breaches
        amounting to a breach of trust.  While a sentence of this type
        is active, the ninny is exiled.  No entity is exiled except as
        required by this rule.  If an exiled entity is ever a player,
        e is deregistered.  An exiled entity CANNOT register.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a criminal
      case within the past week, other than an assignment caused by a
      judgement in an appeal case, CAN be initiated by the defendant
      by announcement.

[CFJ 1713 (called 2 August 2007): An announcement of the form "I call
for judgement to determine whether <player> violated <rule> by
<action>." initiates a criminal case, despite the appearance that it
is asking about veracity rather than about culpability or sentencing.]

[CFJ 1773 (called 28 October 2007): An announcement that claims to
initiate an equity case, and in doing so alleges a rule violation with
all the elements required for a criminal case, does not initiate a
criminal case.]

[CFJ 1720 (called 12 August 2007): Where a criminal charge is
expressed in the form "violating rule NNNN by XXX", the alleged act
for the purposes of the rules is only "XXX".]

Rule 2169/0 (Power=1.7)
Equity Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an equity case.
      An equity case's purpose is to correct a potential injustice in
      the operation of a particular contract.  An equity case CAN be
      initiated by any party to the contract, by announcement which
      clearly identifies the contract, the set of parties to the
      contract, and a state of affairs whereby events have not
      proceeded as envisioned by the contract (such as, but not
      limited to, a party acting in contravention of eir contractual
      obligations).

      The initiation of an equity case begins its pre-trial phase.
      During the pre-trial phase, the case requires a judge.  In the
      pre-trial phase the judge SHALL as soon as possible inform all
      the contracting parties of the case and invite them to submit
      arguments regarding the equitability of the situation.  The
      pre-trial phase ends one week after the parties have been so
      informed, or immediately when all parties have announced that
      they wish to terminate the pre-trial phase.

      The parties to the contract are all unqualified to be assigned
      as judge of the case.

      An equity case has a judicial question on equation, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are the possible agreements
      that the parties could make that would be governed by the rules.
      A judgement is appropriate if and only if it is a reasonably
      equitable resolution of the the situation at hand with respect
      to the matters raised in the initiation of the case and by the
      parties in the course of the case.

      When an applicable question on equation in an equity case has a
      judgement, and has had that judgement continuously for the past
      week, the judgement is in effect as a binding agreement between
      the parties.  In this role it is subject to modification or
      termination by the usual processes governing binding agreements.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in an equity
      case within the past week, other than an assignment caused by a
      judgement in an appeal case, CAN be initiated by any party to
      the contract in question by announcement.

[CFJ 1772 (called 28 October 2007): An equity case cannot be initiated
with the rules as the subject contract.]

Rule 911/16 (Power=1.7)
Appeal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an appeal case.
      An appeal case's purpose is to determine the appropriateness of
      a judgement that has been assigned to a judicial question, and
      make remedy if the judgement was poorly chosen.  The assignment
      of judgement being questioned (appealed against, or appealed) is
      referred to as the prior assignment; the word "prior" in this
      rule is used to refer to the circumstances of the prior
      assignment.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case within the past two weeks, other than an assignment caused
      by a judgement in an appeal case, CAN be initiated by any player
      with 2 support.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of three members, where each
      of the members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior
      case and none of the members is the prior judge.

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition are:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the of the prior judgement

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question

      Initiation of an appeal case renders the prior question
      suspended.  It remains suspended as long as the question on
      disposition in the appeal case has no judgement.  When the
      question on disposition has a judgement, things happen according
      to that judgement:

      * if AFFIRM, the prior judgement is assigned to the prior
        question again

      * if REMAND, the prior question is rendered open again

      * if REASSIGN, the judge of the prior case (if any) is recused,
        and the prior question is rendered open again

      * if OVERRULE with a replacement judgement, the replacement
        judgement is assigned to the prior question

[CFJ 1597 (called 22 December 2006): It is possible to appeal a
judgement even if it is not certain that the judgement exists.]

Patent Titles and Degrees
      A category concerning titles of honor and dishonor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/24 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.  The herald is a low-priority office; its holder is
      responsible for tracking patent titles.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person is said
      to Bear that Patent Title.  When a Patent Title is revoked from
      a person, that person ceases to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.  The Herald's report includes a
      list of each Patent Title that at least one person Bears, with a
      list of which persons Bear it.

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

[CFJ 1525 (called 15 November 2004): If a patent title is defined by
the rules, and previously the rules defined a patent title with the
same spelling but a different award condition, the two are the same
patent title.]

[CFJ 1561 (called 29 April 2005): A patent title cannot be borne by a
non-person.]

[CFJ 1592 (called 1 December 2006): A patent title, once borne, is
borne until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent
title is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.]

[CFJ 1731 (called 23 August 2007): It is possible for a person to bear
more than one instance of a patent title simultaneously.]

[CFJ 1591 (called 1 December 2006): Where a person bears the patent
title X, and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special
meaning, it is correct to say that that person "is an X".]

[Cross-references (7 November 2007): the Herald's duties are:
  * report Patent Titles (rule 649)
  * announce award or revocation of Patent Title (rule 649)
  * report the manner of wins (rule 1922)
  * report win dates for Ministers Without Portfolio (rule 402)]

Rule 1922/19 (Power=1)
Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for the Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as one, with two Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with three Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
           Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
           awarded to any player who has held a particular Office
           continuously for the specified duration.  Each of these
           titles shall be awarded only once per player.

      (d)  Champion, to be awarded to any person who wins the game.
           The Herald's report includes how the player won.

      (e)  Minister Without Portfolio, to be awarded to any player who
           wins the game.  If the number of players bearing this title
           is greater than the number of Prerogatives defined by the
           rules, then this title is administratively revoked from the
           Speaker.

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.  The awarding of a degree is a
      secured change

      A degree SHOULD be awarded ONLY IF its new bearer has published
      a suitable thesis with explicit intent to qualify for a degree
      (though not necessarily for the specific degree being awarded).
      A thesis is an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic or
      of nomic in general.  A thesis's suitability depends on its
      originality and quality, with regard to the rank of the degree
      to be awarded.

Contract Law
      A category concerning binding agreements that can be adjudicated
      within this nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/10 (Power=1.5)
Contracts

      Any group of two or more persons may make an agreement among
      themselves with the intention that it be binding upon them and
      be governed by the rules.  Such an agreement is known as a
      contract.  A contract may be modified, including changing the
      set of parties, by agreement between all parties.  A contract
      may also terminate by agreement between all parties.  A contract
      automatically terminates if the number of parties to it falls
      below two.

      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract.  This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.

      A public contract is a contract that identifies itself as such.
      Any other contract is private.

[CFJ 1796 (called 14 November 2007): If a person announces that e
agrees to be bound by a particular text as a contract, without saying
who this agreement is with, and the contract text does not regulate
who can become a party to it, then any person can become a party to
the contract by announcement.]

[CFJ 1455 (called 14 March 2003): A contract cannot cause an
otherwise-insignificant action by a non-party to constitute consent to
be bound by the contract.]

[CFJ 1686 (called 7 June 2007): A person who is not a party to an
agreement categorically cannot violate it.]

[CFJ 1752 (called 28 September 2007): Deregistration does not
implicitly cause the ex-player to leave a contract.]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): Agreement between all the parties,
to modify or terminate a contract, can be manifested by a contract
between all the parties, including the contract being modified or
terminated.]

Rule 2173/0 (Power=1)
The Notary

      The Notary is a low-priority office; its holder is responsible
      for keeping track of contracts.

      The parties to a public contract SHALL keep the Notary informed
      of its text and set of parties.  The Notary's report includes
      this information for each public contract.

      The parties to a private contract SHOULD keep the Notary
      informed of its text and set of parties.  The Notary SHALL
      disclose this information (to the extent that e has been
      informed of it) to the judge of an equity case pertaining to
      that contract.  The Notary SHALL NOT disclose it otherwise,
      except as explicitly allowed by the contract, or with the
      explicit consent of all parties.

Rule 2145/2 (Power=2)
Partnerships

      A binding agreement governed by the rules which devolves its
      legal obligations onto a subset of its parties, numbering at
      least two, collectively, is a partnership.  The members of a
      partnership are those parties onto whom the partnership's legal
      obligations are collectively devolved.  A partnership's identity
      and partnershiphood are not disrupted by changes to its
      membership provided that it continues to meet the definition of
      a partnership.

      A partnership's basis is the set consisting of the union of the
      set of its non-partnership members with the bases of each of its
      partnership members.  Where circularity occurs in this
      definition, it is resolved by using the minimum basis sets that
      provide consistency.

      A partnership whose basis contains at least two persons is a
      person.

[CFJ 1701 (called 11 July 2007): To qualify as a member of a
partnership it is not necessary to be responsible for all of the
partnership's obligations.]

[CFJ 1750 (called 24 September 2007): Partnerships can have non-player
members and nothing in the rules causes a member to cease being so due
to deregistration.]

Rule 2136/10 (Power=1)
Contests

      Points are a class of fixed assets.  Ownership of points is
      restricted to players.

      Points are a currency.  The number of points owned by a player
      is eir score.

      A contest is an agreement that

      (a) identifies itself as a contest,

      (b) identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster,

      (c) allows any First-class player to become a party,

      (d) is published before any contestants become a party to it,
          and

      (e) is fair to all contestants.

      All parties to the agreement who are not the contestmaster are
      its contestants.

      The Scorekeepor is an office, and the recordkeepor of points.

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per week to
      one or more contestants as permitted by the contest, unless e is
      contestmaster of a different contest simultaneously or has been
      at any time during the preceding span of seven days.

      A player with 100 or more points may win the game by announcing
      this fact.  Upon such an announcement, each player's score is
      set to zero.

[CFJ 1777 (called 4 November 2007): A contest is a contract as
governed by rule 1742.]

[CFJ 1777 (called 4 November 2007): A purported contest that is
created and then dissolved so quickly that there is no practical
opportunity for unaware players to join it is thereby not allowing any
first-class player to become a party, and thereby not a contest.]

[CFJ 1797 (called 14 November 2007): To be "fair to all contestants" a
contract must be fair to all potential contestants, including ones
that are not presently actual contestants.

[CFJ 1762 (called 3 October 2007): A purported contest that allows the
contestmaster to award points at eir discretion is thereby unfair, and
thereby not a contest.]

[Cross-references (29 August 2007): the Scorekeepor's duties are:
  * recordkeepor of points (rule 2136)]

Rule 2147/4 (Power=2)
Protectorates

      Whereas Agora, being the superpower of nomics, has an inherent
      responsibility to lead the nomic world; and whereas Agora
      desires to encourage growth and promotion of the nomic
      community, be it hereby known that Agora shall serve as
      benevolent protector to any nomic which requests such status
      (hereafter referred to as the protectorate).

      In order to become a protectorate, a nomic must specify in its
      ruleset that it submits to Agora as its benevolent protector.
      It must also have rules or other gamestate arranged such that
      any protective decree proclaimed by the ambassador will take
      full effect upon proclamation.  For this purpose, the nomic may
      specify the forum in which proclamation is to be made, provided
      that it is reasonably possible for the ambassador to use the
      specified forum.  Any restriction whatsoever on the content of a
      protective decree disqualifies the nomic from being a
      protectorate.

      If the criteria specified in the preceding paragraph are met,
      the ambassador may make the nomic a protectorate with Agoran
      Consent.  If a protectorate ever does not meet these criteria,
      it ceases to be a protectorate.  The ambassador shall check
      every month whether each protectorate continues to meet the
      criteria, and shall announce whenever a protectorate has ceased
      to be a protectorate.

      The ambassador's report includes a list of all protectorates,
      with contact details for each, and for each the forum in which
      it is most appropriate to proclaim protective decrees that
      target that protectorate.

[Note (25 July 2007): Suggested wording for a protectorate's ruleset:
"Any protective decree of Agora that targets this nomic takes effect
as specified by the rules of Agora.".]

[CFJ 1707 (called 20 July 2007): If a nomic's ruleset contains a
statement similar to "This nomic allows Agora unrestricted access to
make changes to its ruleset.", this can be interpreted as "This
nomic's rules change whenever the rules of Agora say they do.", thus
satisfying the requirement to make protective decrees effective [at
the time of CFJ 1707, the vaguer requirement to allow Agora to change
its ruleset].]

Rule 2159/1 (Power=2)
Protective Decrees

      A protective decree is an act of Agora the intended effect of
      which is to make explicit changes to the state of a protectorate
      nomic.  The changes may include enacting, repealing, or amending
      rules of the protectorate, changing the set of players of the
      protectorate, or any other instantaneous changes to the
      protectorate's gamestate.

      The initiation of a protective decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target protectorate and
      the changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the
      specification of a protective decree causes it to be void and
      without effect.  This is the only mechanism by which a
      protective decree can be initiated.

      As soon as possible after a protective decree has been
      initiated, the ambassador shall proclaim it to the target nomic,
      in whatever forum is most suitable for this purpose.  The decree
      takes effect upon this proclamation.

      Protective decrees should be initiated only for the purpose of
      assisting the protectorate in its growth and enabling its
      longevity.  Protective decrees should always be benevolent.

      All players are prohibited from falsely claiming, to any nomic,
      that a document is a protective decree.

Rule 1727/16 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic, known
      unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played on,
      until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.
