Rule 101/6 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absence of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to invoke judgement, appeal a
            judgement, and to initiate an appeal on a sentencing or
            judicial order binding em.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player has the right to deregister rather than
            continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825: Players must obey the Rules even if no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1627 (called 29 April 2007): The possibility of arbitrary refusal
of CFJs, preventing them being judged, does not infringe the right to
invoke judgement.]

Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if:

      (a) the action is prohibited;

      (b) the rules indicate that if certain conditions are satisfied,
          then some player is permitted to perform the action;

      (c) the action would, as part of its effect, modify information
          for which some player is required to be a recordkeepor;

      (d) the action would, as part of its effect, make it impossible
          to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
          combinations of actions by players; or

      (e) the courts have held that the action is regulated, and this

Rule 1586/3 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      Two Rule-defined entities CANNOT have the same name or nickname.

      If the Rules defining an entity are repealed or amended such
      that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
      properties cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they still
      define that entity but with different properties, then that
      entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever extent
      is possible under the new definitions.

Power

      The power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
      An instrument is an entity with positive power.

      The power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the rules.  All entities have power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

          its own.

      (c) modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with
          power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
          an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
          operation.

Rule 2141/0 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern
      the game generally.  A rule's content takes the form of
      a text, and is unlimited in scope.  In particular, a rule
      may define in-game entities and regulate their behaviour,
      make instantaneous changes to the state of in-game entities,
      prescribe or proscribe certain player behaviour, modify the
      rules or the application thereof, or do any of these things
      in a conditional manner.

      Every rule has power between one and four inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Every rule shall have a number for identification.  If a rule
      ever does not have an identifying number, the Rulekeepor shall
      assign a number to it by announcement as soon as possible.
      The number assigned must be a natural number greater than any
      number previously assigned to a rule.  Once properly assigned,
      a rule's number cannot be changed.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor shall assign
      a title to it by announcement as soon as possible.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, number, and title of a rule are all substantive
      aspects of the rule.

Rule 1482/2 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule
      to stipulate any other means of determining precedence
      between Rules of unequal Power.  This applies to changes by
      the enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit
      such a change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1103 (called 18 August 1998): In the case of conflict between
Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer to the
lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes precedence
over Rule 1482.]

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power [low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858]
Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule of higher Power to mean
something other than its ordinary English meaning, that may or may not
constitute a conflict; whether it does must be decided on a
case-by-case basis.]

Rule 1030/5 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence-determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Rule 105/2 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument;
          any attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes
      that change to be void and without effect.  A variation in
      whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of an existing
      rule does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this
      rule, but any other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
separate attempts at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

Rule 2149/1 (Power=1)
Truthfulness

      Players SHALL NOT deliberately or recklessly make false
      statements in any public message.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.

Rule 869/21 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Each entity at any time either is or is not a player.  The verb
      "to be registered" means to become a player, and the verb "to be
      deregistered" means to cease to be a player.  Where the verb "to
      register" or "to deregister" is used without an explicit direct
      object, the action is implicitly reflexive.  The adjective
      "registered", or its fuller form "registered as a player",
      describes those who are players.

      A person is permitted to register or deregister unless
      specifically prohibited. A person registers or deregisters by
      announcement.

      Whenever a player deregisters, e is prohibited from registering
      for the next thirty days.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person can be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

[CFJ 1648 (called 1 May 2007): Requesting permission to register is to
be interpreted as an announcement attempting to register.]

Rule 2144/5 (Power=1)
Limited Partnerships

      A partnership is prohibited from registering if its basis is the
      same as that of another registered partnership.

      If a registered partnership has the same basis as another
      registered partnership, it can be deregistered by any player
      with Agoran Consent.

Rule 2139/0 (Power=1)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report shall include the following:

      a) Each player's nickname (if any) and listed e-mail address
         (es).
      b) The date on which each player most recently registered.
      c) A list of all public or discussion fora, with sufficient data
         regarding each forum to players to receive messages there.

[CFJ 1703 (called 13 July 2007): A player cannot change eir nickname
by announcement if the new nickname that e specifies is the current
nickname of another player.]

[Cross-references (23 July 2007): the Registrar's duties are:
  * report players' nicknames and email addresses (rule 2139)
  * report registration dates (rule 2139)
  * report fora (rule 2139)
  * report deregistration by Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * report activity (rule 2130)

Rule 1789/3 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

[CFJ 1594 (called 16 December 2006): Players can be deregistered due
to this rule even if there is no Registrar.]

Inactivity

      A player may become active or inactive by announcement.

      A player may, without objection, make another player inactive.

      Registration as a player causes the new player to become active.
      All non-players are inactive.

      The Registrar's report shall indicate, for each player, whether
      the player is active or inactive, and the date on which this
      status last changed.

Rule 478/18 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that No Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

      A Forum's Publicity may be either null, Discussion, or Public
      (default null).  A forum's publicity may not be changed except
      as described in this rule.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A player "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

[CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813: A Player need not prove that e can receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831: The Date: header of a message is not necessarily the time at
which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 866: A message is "received" when the message enters the
recipient's normal technical domain of control, whether this be eir
private machine or eir private account on a shared machine (but not
the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

Rule 754/7 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning, as do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly
          defined by the rules.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.]

Rule 2152/0 (Power=2)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
      a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
      precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
      players in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
      the specified player(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      4. CAN X ONLY IF Y:  Equivalent to "CANNOT X unless Y".  Similar
         for (MUST, MAY, SHALL, SHOULD) X ONLY IF Y.

      5. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      6. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

Rule 1023/21 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrase "as soon as possible" means "within seven days".

      (b) The term "random" means a choice drawn with a process whose
          probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
          reasonably close to that required by the Rules, using a
          uniform distribution if not otherwise specified.

      (c) The term "paragraph" means a subset of text determined as
          follows:

          (1) Each bulleted or enumerated (hereafter simply
              "bulleted") section is a unit of text.

          (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

          (3) Each unit of a document has a level as follows.  All
              unbulleted units have level 1.  Each bulleted unit has
              level n+2, where n is the number of bulleted units it is
              nested inside.

          (4) A barrier between two units is a unit appearing between
              those units which has level no greater than that of the
              unit appearing first.

          (5) The units of a document form an ordered tree, with the
              hierarchy determined as follows.  The root is an empty
              unit with level zero, which nominally appears at the
              beginning of the document.  One unit is a descendant of
              another unit if it appears after the latter, has
              strictly greater level, and is not separated from the
              latter by a barrier.  The tree's ordering follows the
              order of the units in the document.

          (6) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
              determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
              entirety of that quotation.

          (7) A "paragraph" identified by an ordinal n is determined
              by the nth unbulleted unit and its descendants.

          (8) A "paragraph" identified by enumerated section labels is
              determined by the sub-tree arrived at by traversal from
              the root, using the specified series of labels.

      (d) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

Rule 2150/1 (Power=2)
Personhood

      A person is an entity that has the general capacity to be the
      subject of rights and obligations under the rules.  An entity is
      a person if and only if it is defined to be so by rules with
      power 2 or greater.

      Any biological organism that is capable of communicating by
      email in English is a person.

      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.

[CFJ 1700 (called 10 July 2007): The requirement of capability to
communicate by email can be satisfied even if the players of Agora do
not know the organism's email address.]

[CFJ 1685 (called 31 May 2007): Being in a mindless job (e.g.,
keyboard, stenographer, spokesman) may create a rebuttable presumption
against personhood and against one having spoken on one's own behalf.]

Rule 1728/15 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer.  The phrase
      "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection",
      and the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N first-class players have publicly posted
                objections (and not publicly retracted eir objections)
                to the performance of the action; and

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N first-class players other than the player who
                made the announcement under (a) of this rule have
                publicly posted support for the performance of the
                action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections
           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit
           the action to be performed Without N Objections or do not
           permit the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

      (g)  e announces that e performs the described action.

      A dependent action is not performed until announced as in (g).

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      A rule authorising the performance of a dependent action may
      restrict the eligibility of players to support or object to that
      specific action.

Rule 1769/5 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

      within the past week, e may become the speaker, thus removing
      any previous speaker from the office, by announcement, unless
      someone else has become speaker within the preceding 90 days.
      If the legality of an attempted installation of this type is not
      challenged within a week, then it is effective even if later
      found to be illegal.

      A speaker who became speaker within the preceding 90 days cannot
      be replaced by Agoran Consent if e is one of those whose
      objections are counted in the Agoran Consent procedure.

[Cross-references (23 July 2007): the Speaker's duties are:

Rule 1006/19 (Power=1)
Offices

      The Rules may designate positions to be offices.  No office may
      be held by more than one player.  Each office that would
      otherwise not be held by any player shall be held by the
      Speaker, unless it is not possible for the Speaker to hold that
      office.

      The holder of an office may be referred to by the name of the
      office.

      If the duty of an office is to maintain certain information,
      then the officer shall publish that information at least once a
      month, or as soon as possible after a substantial change occurs
      in the information or the officer receives a request for the
      information.  A weekly report shall be sufficient to satisfy
      these last two requirements.

      If a Timing Order directed at an office is not satisfied on
      time, or if the office is vacant, then the player who executed
      the order may perform the duty as if e held that office.

[CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): this rule does not define the meaning
of the term "office", in the sense meant by rule 754, but rather
references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
offices as thus defined.]

Rule 2154/0 (Power=2)
Replacing Officers

      Any Player may make an active Player (hereafter the nominee) the
      holder of an office, thus removing any previous holder from the
      office, with Agoran Consent, provided:
      (a) that office has not changed hands with this method in the
          previous 30 days, and
      (b) the potential officer consents to hold the office after the
          announcement of intent is made.

      If intent to achieve consent for a nominee is announced as
      above, then any other active player may be nominated for the
      position with eir own consent by announcement, during the
      minimum waiting period between intent and action defined for
      Agoran Consent.

      If, at the end of this period, there is more than one consenting
      nominee, then the attempt to achieve Agoran Consent fails, and
      the IADoP shall initiate an Agoran Decision to determine the new
      office holder, meanwhile no further attempt to achieve Agoran
      Consent for the change shall be valid.  The valid options for
      the decision are the nominees, quorum is a minimum of three and
      the number of active players, eligible voters are the active
      players, and the vote collector is the IADoP.  In the notice
      resolving the decision, the IADoP will select one nominee from
      the set of nominees which each received the largest number of
      votes; this chosen nominee becomes the officeholder upon the
      posting of the valid notice.

      If no attempt to achieve Agoran Consent for changing the holder
      of a particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
      IADoP shall make at least one such attempt to change the
      officeholder in the following quarter, and make the change if
      consent is achieved.  This requirement is waived if another
      player changes the officeholder in this way during the following
      quarter.

      no weekly (or, respectively, monthly) report.  Each officer's
      report is an official report.

      The holder of an office for which there is an officer's
      report is obliged to maintain all information in the report.

      ratify, without objection, any official report.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

Rule 1681/10 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
      of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
      mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
      changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
      proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.

Rule 1450/6 (Power=2)
Separation of Powers

      The following sets of positions are mutually exclusive:

      A player holding two or more positions within one of these sets
      is removed from all but one of them.  If one of them is the
      Speakership, then e retains it; otherwise, e retains the
      position e came to hold most recently.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing offices.

[CFJ 1705 (called 18 July 2007): It is possible for a person to hold
two "mutually exclusive" positions simultaneously, albeit only for an
infinitesemal period, because rule 1450 does not prevent this
situation arising but removes the person from one of the positions
when the situation has occurred.]

Rule 107/4 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) The identity of the vote collector.

      (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
          announcement.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The information required in the notice
need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 683/14 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision, and the submitter is an eligible voter at the
          time of submission.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

      Among the otherwise-valid votes on an Agoran decision, only the
      first N submitted by each entity are valid, where N is the
      entity's voting limit on that decision.  The voting limit of an
      entity that is not an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is
      zero.  The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
      decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

Conditional Votes

      A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be submitted
      conditionally, and the truth or falsity of the condition and
      thus the selected option will be determined as it exists at the
      end of the voting period.

      The option selected shall be considered to be clearly identified
      if and only if the truth or falsity of the specified
      condition(s) can be reasonably determined, without circularity
      or paradox, from information published within the voting period.

Rule 2117/0 (Power=3)
Replacing the Vote Collector

      If the rules indicate that an office is to be responsible for
      collecting votes on a particular Agoran decision, then the
      holder of that office is the default vote collector for that
      decision.

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is tardy if
      and only if the voting collector has continuously held that role
      for at least seven days following the end of the voting period
      and the decision has not yet been resolved.  If a vote collector
      is tardy, then the first player to announce that e takes up the
      role of vote collector becomes the vote collector for that
      decision.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow the
      vote collector for an Agoran decision to be changed.

Rule 208/3 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is
      authorized to resolve that decision, and does so by publishing a
      valid notice which states that the matter has been resolved,
      indicating the option selected by Agora.  To be valid, this
      notice must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It clearly identifies the options available.

      (d) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision shall have at most one vote collector at a
      time.  The identity of the vote collector is set by the message
      initiating the decision, and can only be changed as specified by
      other rules with power at least as great as that of this rule.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

Rule 955/10 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      To determine which option on a particular Agoran decision was
      selected by Agora, the vote collector shall perform the
      following steps in order after the voting period has ended.

      (a) E shall invalidate any ballots which the rules require em to
          invalidate, and no others.

      (b) E shall count the number of distinct voters who submitted
          ballots which remain valid.  If this number is less than the
          quorum and there is more than one available option, then the
          option selected by Agora is FAILED QUORUM.  Otherwise, the
          decision achieved quorum.

      (c) If the decision is whether to adopt a proposal, e shall
          determine the voting index as follows:

          (1) if the strength of FOR is positive and the strength of
              AGAINST is zero, then the voting index is Unanimity; but

          (2) if the strength of FOR is zero, then the voting index is
              zero; otherwise,

          (3) the voting index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to
              the strength of AGAINST.

          If the voting index exceeds one and meets or exceeds the
          adoption index of the decision, and if further quorum was
          achieved, then the option selected by Agora is ADOPTED.
          Otherwise, the option selected by Agora is REJECTED.

[CFJs 1605 (called 11 January 2007) and 1608 (called 12 January 2007):
Unanimity exceeds finite numerical adoption indices.]

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is

Rule 2034/2 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change
      the validity of one or more of a voter's ballots on an Agoran
      decision whose voting period has begun but which has not yet
      been resolved shall be wholly without effect, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, no ballots on that
      decision may be validly submitted or retracted, and the outcome
      of the decision may not be changed in any way, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  Nothing in this rule shall be
      construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting
      the resolution of an Agoran decision.

      If the success of the resolution of an Agoran decision is not
      challenged within one week from the time the vote collector
      announces it, then the announced result is the true result of
      that decision, even if it would otherwise be in error.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to the resolution of an
Agoran decision must explicitly identify the decision, either
individually or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy
of some aspect of the attempted resolution.]

Rule 106/8 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The proposer of a
      proposal may remove it from the Pool by announcement.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
      PRESENT, and the adoption index is the adoption index of the
      proposal.

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1,
      with a minimum value of 1.0.  It may be set by the proposer at
      the time of submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.  A
      Proposal with an Adoption Index of less than 2 is Ordinary.  All
      other Proposals are Democratic.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
      which would permit a proposal to take effect.

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

      correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

      receive any rewards for its adoption, rules to the contrary

Rule 1607/13 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal Pool at
      any time.  During each week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool since the beginning
      of that week.

      The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

      When distributing a proposal, the Promotor SHALL specify the
      following:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its adoption index.
      c) Whether it is ordinary or democratic.
      d) Whether it is interested or disinterested.

[CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a proposal is purportedly
distributed with a text that differs from the submitted text, this
constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted proposal if and only
if the difference does not affect the meaning of the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal distribution
of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[Cross-references (1 July 2007): the Promotor's duties are:
  * not distribute proposals during holiday (rule 1769)
  * track Proposal Pool (rule 106)
  * distribute proposals (rule 1607)]

Rule 2156/1 (Power=2)
Voting on Ordinary Proposals

      Each player has a parameter known as eir base voting limit on
      ordinary proposals (BVLOP).  The BVLOP of a first-class player
      is four, and the BVLOP of any other player is zero.  BVLOP
      cannot be modified.

      Each player has a parameter known as eir volatile voting limit
      on ordinary proposals (VVLOP).  Whenever a player is registered,
      eir VVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.  VVLOP can be modified by the
      action of an instrument with power greater than or equal to the
      power of this rule, but not by any other means.

      Each player has a parameter known as eir effective voting limit
      on ordinary proposals (EVLOP).  Whenever a player is registered,
      eir EVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.  At the end of each week, each
      player's EVLOP is set to eir VVLOP, rounded to an integer,
      breaking ties towards odd integers, and eir VVLOP is set to the
      same rounded value.  EVLOP cannot be modified by any other
      means.  The assessor's report includes each player's EVLOP.

      The eligible voters on an ordinary proposal are those entities
      that were active players at the start of its voting period.  The
      voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary proposal is eir
      EVLOP at the start of its voting period.

Rule 2134/0 (Power=1)
Win by Voting Power

      If a single player has a voting power on ordinary proposals
      equal to or greater than the total voting power on ordinary
      proposals of all other players combined, that player wins the
      game upon any player announcing the fact.

Rule 2126/13 (Power=2)
Voting Credits

      Voting Credits (VCs) are a measure of each player's ability to
      affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  VCs CANNOT be
      affected except as described in this rule.

      When a player registers or deregisters, e loses all eir VCs.

      The assessor's report includes the number of VCs of each color
      possessed by each player.

      When one or more players win the game, each player's VVLOP is
      set to eir BVLOP.

      Each VC has a color (Gray if not otherwise specified).  If a
      player loses a color of VC that e does not possess, then e loses
      a VC of eir Party's color instead; if e has no VCs at all, then
      the loss is waived (you can't get blood from a turnip).

      VCs may be gained as follows:

      a) When an ordinary interested proposal is adopted, its proposer
         gains Red VCs equal to the integer portion of the proposal's
         adoption index (unless e gained VCs in this way earlier in
         the same week), and each co-author of the proposal gains one
         Red VC (unless e gained VCs in this way earlier in the same
         week).

      b) At the end of each month, for each office, the player (if
         any) who held that office for the majority of that month
         gains two Green VCs, unless the Speaker publicly announces
         within a week after the end of the month that the officer
         performed eir duties poorly or not at all.

      c) A player who assigns a judgement to a judicial question
         within the time limit when first obliged to gains one Blue
         VC.

      VCs may be lost as follows:

      a) When a proposal's voting index is less than half its adoption
         index, its proposer loses one Red VC.

      b) When an officer forfeits eir salary due to announcement by
         the Speaker, e loses one Green VC.

      c) A player who is recused from a judicial case because a
         judicial question has remained applicable, open, and unjudged
         loses one Blue VC.  A player who is the prior judge in an
         appeal case where a judgement other than AFFIRM is assigned
         to the question on disposition loses one Blue VC.

      VCs may be spent as follows, by announcement (INVALID unless the
      color is specified):

      a) A player may spend two VCs of different colors to increase
         another player's VVLOP by one.

      b) A player may spend three VCs of different colors to increase
         eir own VVLOP by one.

      c) A player may spend two VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by one (to a minimum of zero).

      d) A player may spend three VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by ten percent.

Orders
      A category concerning certain entities with powers of

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1793/3 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by an entity and directed to
      some entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action,
      or to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an official position
      in eir capacity in that official position, and if the position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      position.

      An Order may also be directed at a prior order so as to affect
      the prior order's operation, as the Rules permit.

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class are presumed valid and enforceable until proven
      otherwise by CFJ.

Classes of Orders

      Each Order is of exactly one of the following classes.  If an

      the first class that matches.

        (a) A Legislative Order is an Order executed as part of the
            effect of the adoption of a Proposal.

        (b) A Timing Order is an Order which may be executed by any
            person by announcement and directed at any entity.  A
            timing order is valid if and only if it orders the entity
            to perform, as soon as possible, a duty specifically
            required of em by the Rules that does not otherwise have a
            specified timing requirement, or for which the otherwise
            specified timing requirement will have been exceeded as
            soon as possible after the Order is executed.

      No other types of Orders are valid.

Rule 1799/3 (Power=1)
Stay and Vacation of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily prevent the
      stayed Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be specified to expire after a fixed time.  If no
      specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall not
      expire.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

      Any Order may always be stayed or vacated by the Player (or, in
      the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.
      Certain classes of Orders may be stayed or vacated in other
      circumstances as well, but only as the Rules allow.

      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.  Except when otherwise
      specified, a single action can result in the satisfaction of at
      most one Order.  If an action would satisfy more than one Order,
      and no other specification is made, the Action satisfies the
      oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      A player SHALL NOT willfully perform contrary to a valid
      unsatisfied order, either through action or inaction.

Adjudication
      A category concerning the judicial system by which matters of
      controversy are resolved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/8 (Power=2)
Judicial Cases Generally

      A judicial case, also known as a call for judgement (CFJ), is a
      procedure to settle a matter of controversy.  There are
      subclasses of judicial case with particular features defined by
      other rules.  Subclasses of judicial case exist only as defined
      by the rules.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office, responsible for
      managing judicial activity.  The CotC's report includes the
      status of all judicial cases that either require a judge or have
      at least one applicable judicial question that has no judgement.

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[Cross-references (23 July 2007): the Clerk of the Courts' duties are:
  * issue Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * not assign judges during holiday (rule 1769)
  * report open judicial cases (rule 991)
  * assign judge to judicial case (rule 1868)
  * report posture (rule 1871)
  * consider posture when assigning judges (rule 1871)
  * change all sitting players to standing (rule 1871)
  * recuse tardy judge (rule 2158)

Rule 1868/7 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge;
      this is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.  To recuse a judge from a case means to deassign em as
      judge.  To assign a judge to a case implicitly recuses any
      existing judge.

      At any time, a judicial case either does not require a judge
      (default) or requires a judge; this is not a persistent status,
      but is evaluated instantaneously.

      When a judicial case requires a judge and has no judge assigned,
      the CotC CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by
      announcement.  Whenever this situation arises the CotC SHALL
      make such an assignment as soon as possible.

      Except where modified by other rules, the entities qualified to
      be assigned as judge of a judicial case are the active
      first-class players.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a
      judge does not inherently prevent an entity from continuing to
      be judge if already assigned.

[CFJ 1186: The Clerk of the Courts is required by Rule 1868 to select
a Judge who is qualified ["eligible" at the time of CFJ 1186] at the
time that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
qualified at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced.]

Rule 1871/13 (Power=1.5)
The Standing Court

      Each player is either standing, sitting, or supine; this status
      is known as eir posture.  The CotC's report includes each
      player's posture.  When an entity becomes a player, e is
      initially supine.  A player CAN change emself from sitting to
      supine, or from supine to sitting, by announcement.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  The CotC SHALL NOT assign a sitting player to be
      the judge of any judicial case.  If the CotC has assigned a
      sitting player as judge, and that player is still the judge of
      that case, the CotC CAN recuse that judge from that case by
      announcement.

      When the CotC assigns a standing player as judge of a judicial
      case, the player becomes sitting, except in the situation
      discussed in the next sentence.  If the CotC assigns a standing
      player as judge of more than one judicial case consecutively in
      the same announcement, and states in the announcement that these
      are linked assignments, the player becomes sitting upon the last
      of these assignments, but not any of the earlier ones.  The CotC
      SHOULD NOT perform linked assignments unless the cases being
      linked are closely related in their subject matter.

      The CotC CAN change all sitting players to standing by
      announcement.  The CotC SHALL NOT do this unless there is a
      judicial case to which e is obliged to assign a judge, all
      entities qualified to be so assigned are sitting players, and e
      immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns a
      judge to that case.

Rule 2157/0 (Power=1.7)
Judicial Panels

      A judicial panel is a structure whereby a group of two or more
      persons (its members) act together for the purpose of judging
      judicial cases.  A judicial panel's membership cannot change,
      and if two panels have the same membership then they are the
      same panel.  Judicial panels exist implicitly, without any
      specific act of formation.

      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous agreement of the panel's members.  By this
      mechanism a judicial panel can act, in situations where the
      rules state that an action is performed by sending a message.  A
      judicial panel can incur obligations.  The members of a panel
      SHALL act collectively to ensure that the panel satisfies all of
      its obligations.

Rule 2158/0 (Power=2)
Judicial Questions

      Within a judicial case, one or more judicial questions may
      arise.  Each judicial question is either inapplicable (default)
      or applicable; this is not a persistent status but is evaluated
      instantaneously.  Each judicial question either is open
      (default), suspended, or has a particular judgement; this is a
      persistent status that changes only according to the rules.  The
      possible types of judgement for a judicial question vary
      according to the type of question.

      When a judicial case has an applicable open judicial question,
      it requires a judge, and its judge CAN assign a valid judgement
      to that question by announcement.  Whenever there is a judge
      assigned to a judicial case with an applicable open question,
      the judge SHALL assign such a judgement to the question as soon
      as possible.

      Whenever a judicial case has a judicial question that has
      remained applicable and open, while the same judge has been
      assigned to the case, continuously for the past week, the CotC
      CAN recuse that judge by announcement.  Whenever a judicial case
      has a judicial question that has remained applicable and open,
      while the same judge has been assigned to the case, continuously
      for the past two weeks, the CotC SHALL so recuse the judge as
      soon as possible.

      Among the possible judgements of a judicial question, some
      subset of them are appropriate.  Judgements are appropriate only
      where so defined by the rules.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an
      inappropriate judgement.  Where more than one appropriate
      judgement is available, the choice between them is at the
      judge's discretion.

Rule 591/20 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an inquiry case.
      An inquiry case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a
      particular statement.  An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any
      person, by announcement which includes the statement to be
      inquired into.

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable, nonsensical, too vague, or otherwise not capable
        of being accurately described as either false or true, at the
        time the inquiry case was initiated

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement at
        the time the inquiry case was initiated is not relevant to the
        game

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE,
        and UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however,
        uncertainty as to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot
        constitute insufficiency of information for this purpose

      The judgement of the question in an inquiry case SHOULD guide
      future play, including future judgements, but does not directly
      affect the veracity of the statement.  The rulekeepor is
      ENCOURAGED to annotate rules to draw attention to relevant
      inquiry case judgements.

Rule 1504/10 (Power=1.7)
Criminal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as a criminal case.
      A criminal case's purpose is to determine the culpability of a
      particular person, known as the defendant, for an alleged breach
      of the rules, and to punish the guilty.  A criminal case CAN be
      initiated by any player, by announcement which clearly
      identifies the defendant and specifies the action (which may be
      a failure to perform another action) by which the defendant
      allegedly breached the rules.

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      During the pre-trial phase, the case requires a judge.  In the
      pre-trial phase the judge SHALL as soon as possible inform the
      defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument for
      eir guilt.  The pre-trial phase ends one week after the
      defendant has been so informed.

      The initiator and defendant are each unqualified to be assigned
      as judge of the case.  During the pre-trial phase, the defendant
      CAN disqualify one person from assignment as judge of the case,
      by announcement.  If e disqualifies the judge, then the judge is
      recused.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on culpability, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are:

      * ALREADY TRIED, appropriate if judgement has already been
        reached in another criminal case with the same defendant and
        substantially the same alleged act

      * UNIMPUGNED, appropriate if the alleged act was not proscribed
        by the rules at the time it allegedly occurred

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act

      * SLIPPERY, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine beyond a reasonable doubt
        whether or not the defendant performed the alleged act

      * EXCUSED, appropriate if the defendant has good reason why e
        could not avoid breaching the rules in a manner at least as
        serious as alleged

      * GUILTY, appropriate if none of the above judgements is
        appropriate

      A criminal case has a judicial question on sentencing, which is
      applicable if the question on culpability is applicable and has
      a judgement of GUILTY.  If a criminal case has an applicable
      question on sentencing which has a judgement, the defendant is
      hereafter known as the ninny, the judgement in the question on
      sentencing is known as the sentence, and the sentence is in
      effect.

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      thereafter either active or not.  The sentence is inactive for
      the first week after it first takes effect.  Thereafter, the
      sentence is active if and only if it is still in effect and
      sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
      have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.  The
      CotC's report includes the status of all active judgements.

      The valid sentences are:

      * DISCHARGE, appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances, if
        any available non-null punishment would be manifestly unjust.
        Has no effect.

      * APOLOGY with a set of up to ten words (the prescribed words),
        appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.  When in
        effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours publish a formal
        apology of at least 200 words, including all the prescribed
        words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
        for self-improvement.  The ninny is only obliged to publish
        one apology per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
        this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
        than once.

      * CHOKEY with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied
        by the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for rule breaches of
        intermediate severity.  While a sentence of this type is
        active, the ninny is in the chokey.  No entity is in the
        chokey except as required by this rule.

      * EXILE with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied by
        the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for severe rule breaches
        amounting to a breach of trust.  While a sentence of this type
        is active, the ninny is exiled.  No entity is exiled except as
        required by this rule.  If an exiled entity is ever a player,
        e is deregistered.  An exiled entity CANNOT register.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a criminal
      case within the past week, other than an assignment caused by a
      judgement in an appeal case, CAN be initiated by the defendant
      by announcement.

Rule 911/16 (Power=1.7)
Appeal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an appeal case.
      An appeal case's purpose is to determine the appropriateness of
      a judgement that has been assigned to a judicial question, and
      make remedy if the judgement was poorly chosen.  The assignment
      of judgement being questioned (appealed against, or appealed) is
      referred to as the prior assignment; the word "prior" in this
      rule is used to refer to the circumstances of the prior
      assignment.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case within the past two weeks, other than an assignment caused
      by a judgement in an appeal case, CAN be initiated by any player
      with 2 support.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of three members, where each
      of the members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior
      case and none of the members is the prior judge.

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition are:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the of the prior judgement

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question

      Initiation of an appeal case renders the prior question
      suspended.  It remains suspended as long as the question on
      disposition in the appeal case has no judgement.  When the
      question on disposition has a judgement, things happen according
      to that judgement:

      * if AFFIRM, the prior judgement is assigned to the prior
        question again

      * if REMAND, the prior question is rendered open again

      * if REASSIGN, the judge of the prior case (if any) is recused,
        and the prior question is rendered open again

      * if OVERRULE with a replacement judgement, the replacement
        judgement is assigned to the prior question

Rule 217/5 (Power=3)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom, common
      sense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game
      before applying other standards.

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

[CFJ 897: The requirements in Rule 217 on Judgements apply to the
determinations of the members of a Board of Appeal, as well as to the
Judgements of Judges.]

[CFJ 1139: Judgements need not necessarily accord with the reasoning
and arguments of Judges or Justices given in past CFJs.]

[CFJ 1219: A mistaken Judgement (ie one that does not accord with the
Rules) is still a Judgement, as long as the technical requirements on
the delivery of the Judgement have been met.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the issuance of a CFJ even if public knowledge
at the time of issuance was not sufficient to determine it.]

      Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding

Rule 1922/13 (Power=1)
Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for the Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as one, with two Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with three Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
           Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
           awarded to any player who has held a particular Office
           continuously for the specified duration.  Each of these
           titles shall be awarded only once per player.

      (d)  Champion, to be awarded to any player who wins the game.  The
           Herald's report shall record how the player won.

      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.  A degree CAN be awarded by the
      action of an instrumennt with power greater than or equal to the
      power of this rule, but CANNOT be awarded in any other way.

      A degree SHOULD be awarded ONLY IF its new bearer has published
      a suitable thesis with explicit intent to qualify for a degree
      (though not necessarily for the specific degree being awarded).
      A thesis is an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic or
      of nomic in general.  A thesis's suitability depends on its
      originality and quality, with regard to the rank of the degree
      to be awarded.

Contract Law
      A category concerning binding agreements that can be adjudicated

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/9 (Power=1.5)
Contracts

      Any group of two or more persons may make an agreement among
      themselves with the intention that it be binding upon them and
      be governed by the rules.  Such an agreement is known as a
      contract.  A contract may be modified, including changing the
      set of parties, by agreement between all parties.  A contract
      may also terminate by agreement between all parties.  A contract
      automatically terminates if the number of parties to it falls
      below two.

      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract.  This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.

[CFJ 1686 (called 7 June 2007): A person who is not a party to an
agreement categorically cannot violate it.]

Rule 2145/2 (Power=2)
Partnerships

      A binding agreement governed by the rules which devolves its
      legal obligations onto a subset of its parties, numbering at
      least two, collectively, is a partnership.  The members of a
      partnership are those parties onto whom the partnership's legal
      obligations are collectively devolved.  A partnership's identity
      and partnershiphood are not disrupted by changes to its
      membership provided that it continues to meet the definition of
      a partnership.

      A partnership's basis is the set consisting of the union of the
      set of its non-partnership members with the bases of each of its
      partnership members.  Where circularity occurs in this
      definition, it is resolved by using the minimum basis sets that
      provide consistency.

      A partnership whose basis contains at least two persons is a
      person.

[CFJ 1701 (called 11 July 2007): To qualify as a member of a
partnership it is not necessary to be responsible for all of the
partnership's obligations.]

Rule 2136/7 (Power=1)
Contests

      Points are a measure of a player's contentiousness.  The number
      of points possessed by a player is eir score.

      Each player's score is an integer.  Points can only be awarded
      in integer amounts.

      When a player registers or deregisters, eir score becomes zero.

      A contest is an agreement that identifies itself as such, and
      identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster; all other
      parties are its contestants.

      The Scorekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of scores and contests.  The Scorekeepor's report
      includes each player's score.

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per week to
      one or more contestants as permitted by the contest, unless e
      was contestmaster of a different contest for at least 3 days of
      the previous week.

      A player with 100 or more points may win the game by announcing
      this fact.  Upon such an announcement, each player's score is
      set to zero.

[Cross-references (18 July 2007): the Scorekeepor's duties are:
  * report scores (rule 2136)]

Herald to Advertise

      Every month the Herald shall update the page about Agora on the

      This page, when updated, is to include a list of the current
      players.  In updating the page the Herald shall ensure that
      information that is currently incorrect is either corrected or
      removed, and that all links on the page point to extant pages
      that are correctly described.  The Herald may add new correct
      information to the page at eir discretion.

      The Herald is encouraged to also advertise Agora in other
      suitable locations.

Ambassador

      The Ambassador is an office; Its holder is Agora's liaison to
      its Protectorates. The Ambassador's report shall include a
      listing of Protectorates as well as a list of recent events
      related to those Protectorates. On a minimum of a monthly basis,
      the Ambassador shall review each Protectorate to ensure it meets
      the requirements of a Protectorate.

      The Ambassador may act on behalf of Agora for an action that is
      permitted of Agora in the Protectorate's ruleset, with the
      exception of direct changes to that Protectorate's ruleset as
      described above. Any Player may, with Agoran consent, require
      that the Ambassador act or not act in a specified fashion in
      relation to a Protectorate.

[Cross-references (18 July 2007): the Ambassador's duties are:
  * report on Protectorates (rule 2148)
  * check that Protectorate still meets requirements (rule 2148)
  * act on behalf of Agora in Protectorate (rule 2148)]

Rule 2147/0 (Power=2)
Protectorates

      Whereas Agora, being the superpower of nomics, has an inherent
      responsibility to lead the nomic world; and whereas Agora
      desires to encourage growth and promotion of the nomic
      community, be it hereby known that Agora shall serve as
      benevolent protector to any nomic which requests such status
      (hereafter referred to as the Protectorate).

      In order to become a Protectorate, a nomic must specify in its
      ruleset that it submits to Agora as its benevolent protector. It
      also must allow Agora unrestricted access to make changes to its
      ruleset. A player of said nomic may then cause that nomic to
      become a Protectorate by announcement to the public forum. A
      nomic that no longer meets these requirements ceases to be a
      Protectorate.

      Agora shall treat a Protectorate in a benevolent fashion, making
      changes to that nomic's ruleset only for the purpose of
      assisting that nomic in its growth and enabling its longevity.
      Agora may only make changes to a Protectorate's ruleset through
      a Proposal with an Adoption Index of 2 or more, although this
      does not prohibit changes made to a Protectorate nomic by one or
      more of its players (or closest equivalent) according to the
      rules of that Protectorate.

[CFJ 1704 (called 17 July 2007): If a nomic is a binding agreement
governed by the rules of Agora, then the possibility of direct
modification of that agreement by an Agoran proposal satisfies the
requirement for protectoratehood that it allow Agora unrestricted
access to make changes to its ruleset.]

[CFJ 1707 (called 20 July 2007): If a nomic's ruleset contains a
statement similar to "This nomic allows Agora unrestricted access to
make changes to its ruleset.", this can be interpreted as "This
nomic's rules change whenever the rules of Agora say they do.", thus
allowing the nomic's ruleset to be changed by means of an Agoran
proposal with AI >= 2.]

Rule 1727/16 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic, known
      unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played on,
      until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.
