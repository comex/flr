Rule 101/13 (Power=3)
The Rights of Agorans

      WHEREAS Agora, since its inception, has functioned not only as a
      game but as a society, and WHEREAS a society, to function, must
      balance its Rules with the natural rights of its participants,
      BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that no interpretation of Agoran law or
      binding agreement may substantially limit or remove a person's
      rights as defined by this Rule, except through the explicit and
      legal amendment of this Rule.  This rule takes precedence over
      any rule which would allow or mandate restrictions of the rights
      contained herein.

         i. Every person has the right, though not necessarily the
            ability, to perform actions that are not prohibited or
            regulated by the Rules, with the sole exception of
            changing the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules
            explicitly or implicitly permit it.

        ii. Every person has the right to initiate a formal process to
            resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable
            expectation that the controversy will thereby be resolved.
            Every person has the right to cause formal reconsideration
            of any judicial determination that e should be punished.

       iii. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

        iv. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, or a Rule
            Change, which e has not had the reasonable opportunity to
            review.  For the purpose of protecting this right, a rule
            change which would otherwise take effect without its
            substance being subject to general player review through a
            reasonably public process is wholly prevented from taking
            effect.

         v. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

        vi. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.  However, this
            right is not violated by replacing part or all of a
            penalty with a different but comparable penalty, e.g. when
            the rules governing penalties are amended.

       vii. Every player has the right to deregister; e may continue
            to accrue obligations and penalties after deregistration
            but, if e wishes to ignore the game, such penalties shall
            not unduly harass em.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825 (called 7 November 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if
no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1848 (called 21 December 2007): The game must operate according
to the rules that prevail at the time, and not attempt to incorporate
any retroactive changes made in the future.]

[CFJ 1709 (called 26 July 2007): The rules are binding on all those
who play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they
have the rule-defined status of "player".]

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1488 (called 11 February 2004): Engineering a situation in which
other players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself
a violation of that rule.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): The requirement that "no
interpretation of Agoran law may abridge ... a person's defined
rights" means that it must be feasible, given the practical limits of
Agoran evidence-gathering, to remain reasonably sure that a person's
defined rights are not being limited.]

[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): The right of participation in the
fora is the right to participate in them for their intended purposes,
and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner
and type of participation.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): An obligation on a player to not
publish statements that e believes are true would conflict with the
right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1753 (called 28 September 2007): The right to cease playing
applies only to those who have the rule-defined status of "player",
not to those who play the game in the broader sense without having
that official status.]

[CFJs 1911-1914 (called 18 March 2008): Physical realities supersede
the Rules by default.]

[CFJ 2220 (called 11 October 2008): Consent to join a binding
agreement may be an effect of another action, such as joining a
foreign nomic, as long as the action is triggered by free will and the
actor is reasonably aware of the effect.]

[CFJ 2246 (called 30 October 2008): Joining a contract does not imply
consent to be acted on behalf of simply because the contract might be
amended in the future to allow it.]

[CFJ 2264 (called 11 November 2008): The right to refuse to become
party to an agreement does not apply to amendments to existing
agreements.]

[CFJ 2361 (called 26 January 2009): The withholding of a reward for
doing something may or may not constitute a penalty for not doing it,
depending on the circumstances.]

[CFJ 2395 (called 1 March 2009): Even without this being explicitly
specified in the rules, it is possible for a non-player to violate a
rule by missing a deadline.]

[CFJ 2410 (called 11 March 2009): Consent to join a binding agreement
may be given privately.]

Rule 2125/7 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      A regulated action is an action satisfying any of the following:

      a) It is IMPOSSIBLE.

      b) It is ILLEGAL.

      c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.  In particular, if
         the action in question is publishing a type of document, then
         a public message is not that type of document (even if it is
         labeled as such) except as allowed by the rules.

      d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Except as allowed by the
         rules, performing such an action is the Class-N Crime of
         Restricted Behavior, where N is the maximum power of the
         rules explicitly allowing it (rounded up as needed to become
         a valid Class of Crime).

      e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for which
         some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such an action
         CANNOT modify that information except as allowed by the
         rules.

      f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated, and
         has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.

      A person SHOULD NOT violate a rule.

Rule 1586/7 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules (hereafter documents) attempt to define an
      entity with the same name, then they refer to the same entity.
      A document-defined entity's name CANNOT be changed to be the
      same as another document-defined entity's name.

      A document referring to an entity by name refers to the entity
      that had that name when the document first came to include that
      reference, even if the entity's name has since changed.

      If the documents defining an entity are repealed or amended such
      that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
      properties cease to exist.

      If the documents defining an entity are amended such that they
      still define that entity but with different properties, then
      that entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever
      extent is possible under the new definitions.

[CFJ 1807 (called 25 November 2007): Rule-defined entities include
pending timed events, which can therefore occur under modified rules
even if the events that originally triggered them would not trigger
them under the new rules.]

[CFJ 1922 (called 4 April 2008): Without legislation to the contrary,
documents attempting to define an entity with the same name define
distinct entities.]

Rule 1688/6 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.  An
      Instrument is an entity with positive Power.

      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have Power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      A Rule that secures a change, action, or value (hereafter the
      securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the
      securing Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      Rule (including by the Rule itself).

Rule 2140/0 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can

      (a) cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

      (b) adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than
          its own.

      (c) modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with
          power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of

The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and a figurehead of Agora. The

      The Speaker is the single first-class player (if any) who holds
      the most Postulated Offices.

      The Speaker CAN, by announcement, cause the President to take
      actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE, except for

======================================================================
Rules
      A category concerning the rules of the game, including the
      processes of changing the rules.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2141/5 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
      game generally, and is always taking effect.  A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.  In
      particular, a rule may define in-game entities and regulate
      their behaviour, make instantaneous changes to the state of
      in-game entities, prescribe or proscribe certain player
      behaviour, modify the rules or the application thereof, or do
      any of these things in a conditional manner.

      Every rule has power between one and four inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor, and are
      strictly ordered.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor shall assign
      a title to it by announcement as soon as possible.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.

[CFJ 1498 (called 12 April 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a
name for the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the
uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.]

[CFJ 2013 (called 17 June 2009): Rule 2141 does not imply that the
power of rules is physically unlimited: they can only affect the world
outside the game by prescribing or proscribing player behavior.]

[CFJ 2213 (called 7 October 2008): The powers granted to rules by the
first paragraph of Rule 2141 are general, and only apply as otherwise
stated by the Rules.]

Rule 217/6 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

[CFJ 1139: Interpretations [judgements at the time of CFJ 1139] need
not necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
Justices given in past CFJs.]

Rule 1030/9 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.

      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule
        with the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the
        lower Power ; otherwise,

      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
        the precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,

      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
        takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then
        such provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless
        they lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,

      - The Rule with the lower ID number takes precedence.

      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g.
      over "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie,
      considered to be limited claims of precedence or deference that
      are applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described
      within the above sequence.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of
      determining precedence.  This applies to changes by the
      enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.  This
      Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit such a
      change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Rule 105/5 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The ID number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument; any
          attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
      variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
      constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
      other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 1499 (called 20 April 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 1 April 2007): If a
low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is different
from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal itself.]

[CFJ 708 (called October 1994): An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is
not a legal Rule Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
separate attempts at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

[CFJ 2201 (called 30 September 2008): The permission required by Rule
105 need not be explicit.]

Rule 1681/18 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, rules are assigned to the same category and
      presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR must contain
      all the information required to be in the SLR, and any
      historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      a) The type of change.

      b) The date on which the change took effect.

      c) The mechanism that specified the change.

      d) If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
         proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Players
      A category concerning players, including the processes of
      becoming and ceasing to be players, and game-relevant aspects of
      players.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/31 (Power=2)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.  Changes to
      citizenship are secured.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A first-class person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time.

      A second-class person CAN register with Agoran Consent.

      A non-person CANNOT be registered (or created in a Registered
      state), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement. A person CANNOT
      register within thirty days after being deregistered by any
      means other than by a mechanism that the rules explicitly
      describe as a means of honorable deregistration.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

Rule 2170/6 (Power=3)
Who Am I?

      Rules regarding persons pertain to those persons directly, not
      to rule-defined avatars or other entities representing those
      persons within Agora.

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement intended to mislead
      others as to the identity of its publisher.

      A player SHALL NOT select a confusing nickname, including but
      not limited to a name that has generally been used to refer to
      another entity within the past three months.

      A public message's (possibly implicit) claim as to the identity
      of its publisher is self-ratifying, provided that the claim is
      neither ambiguous nor self-contradictory, and no challenge of
      identity pertaining to the claimed publisher has been issued
      within one month before its publication.  Upon a judicial
      finding that the claimed publisher of one or more messages
      (hereafter the Sock Puppet) was not a person, if any of those
      claims have already self-ratified, then the judge SHALL as soon
      as possible publish a judicial declaration that the Sock Puppet
      was a person during one or more time periods, and SHOULD ensure
      that it corresponds to general belief prior to that finding.

      The Executor of a public message is the first-class person who
      sends it, or who most directly and immediately causes it to be
      sent.  (Upon a judicial finding that the Executor of a public
      message cannot otherwise be determined within reasonable effort,
      the judge SHALL as soon as possible publish a judicial
      declaration specifying the identity of that message's Executor.)
      The executor of an action performed by announcement is the
      executor of the announcement.

[CFJs 2184-2192 (called 24 September 2008): A message signature
containing a unique nickname is not a self-ratifying claim that its
publisher is distinct from other generally-recognized persons.]

[CFJ 2300 (called 5 December 2008): The Executor of a public message
is not necessarily a person who took action at the time the message
was sent.]

[CFJ 2325 (called 5 January 2009): Only the selection of a nickname
for the purposes of Agora is relevant to this rule.]

Rule 2150/6 (Power=3)
Personhood

      A person is an entity defined as such by rules with power of at
      least 2.  A person CAN generally be the subject of rights and
      obligations under the rules.

      Any biological organism that is generally capable of
      communicating by email in English (including via a translation
      service) is a person.

      A first-class person is a person of a biological nature.  All
      other persons are second-class.

      The basis of a first-class person is the singleton set
      consisting of that person.

[CFJ 1700 (called 10 July 2007): The requirement of capability to
communicate by email can be satisfied even if the players of Agora do
not know the organism's email address.]

[CFJ 1685 (called 31 May 2007): Being in a mindless job (e.g.,
keyboard, stenographer, spokesman) may create a rebuttable presumption
against personhood and against one having spoken on one's own behalf.]

[CFJ 2398 (called 3 March 2009): Young children may or may not be
considered persons, depending on their communication skills.]

Rule 2139/3 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes:

      a) A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      b) The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      c) The Activity of each player, and when each Inactive player
         became Inactive.
      d) For each former player for which the information is
         reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
         deregistered.

      The portion of a public message purporting to be a Registrar's
      report that lists each player implies that no players other than
      those listed exist and is self-ratifying.

[CFJ 1703 (called 13 July 2007): A player cannot change eir nickname
by announcement if the new nickname that e specifies is the current
nickname of another player.]

[CFJ 1361 (called 7 May 2002): Purporting to assign a new nickname,
previously unused to refer to any entity, to another player is
successful, but does not displace the target's existing name or
nickname.]

[CFJ 1489 (called 11 February 2004): Watchers are not a rule-defined
element of the game.]

[CFJ 1420 (called 17 December 2002): The list of watchers, customarily
published with the registrar's report, is part of the game state, even
though it is not mentioned in the rules and no one is obliged to track
or publish it.]

[Cross-references (13 February 2008): the Registrar's duties are:
  * track citizenship (rule 869)
  * report players' identity and contact details (rule 2139)
  * report registration dates (rule 2139)
  * issue Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * report deregistration by Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * track player activity and report change dates (rule 2130)
  * track forum publicity (rule 478)
  * report fora (rule 478)
  * change the publicity of a forum (rule 478)]

Rule 1789/7 (Power=2)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled
      a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar Reports.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

[CFJ 1594 (called 16 December 2006): Players can be deregistered due
to this rule even if there is no Registrar.]

[CFJ 2358 (called 26 January 2009): A document which is labeled as a
Cantus Cygneus but does not actually detail grievances, etc. is not a
Cantus Cygneus.]

Rule 2130/11 (Power=2)
Activity

      Activity is a player switch with values Active (default) and
      Inactive, tracked by the Registrar.  The Registrar's report
      includes the date on which each non-Active player's activity
      last changed.

      A player CAN flip eir activity by announcement.  "To go on hold"
      is to become Inactive; "to come off hold" is to become Active.

      A player CAN flip another player's activity to Inactive without
      objection.

      A player who has been continuously Inactive for at least three
      months CAN be deregistered by any other player without
      objection.  This is a means of honorable deregistration.

      Having been inactive within the past week is a Losing Condition.

======================================================================
Definitions
      A category of definitions of terms and procedures that are
      widely used and do not readily fall into any other category.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 754/14 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, capitalization, or
          dialect, or the use of a synonym or abbreviation in place of
          a word or phrase is inconsequential in all forms of
          communication, as long as the difference does not create an
          ambiguity in meaning, except for the purpose of reporting on
          or quoting the text of a legal document.  A difference
          between two nonempty spans of whitespace is inconsequential
          in all forms of communication for all purposes.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning when used in any Rule of equal or lesser power, as
          do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly defined by
          the rules.

          The following clauses, where X and Y are both nouns or noun
          phrases, mean "X is/are defined as Y" unless they obviously
          have a different meaning:

            a) "X is/are Y"
            b) "Y is/are known as X"

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
      definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, are relevant and
      may provide guidance in helping to determine the meaning of a
      rule, but are not binding (especially if they differ greatly
      from the definitions that would be used otherwise).

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 1439 (called 20 February 2003): A difference in language
qualifies as a difference in dialect; it is possible to take game
actions by messages in languages other than English.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): If a message is in a language other
than English, and its intended audience does not understand the
language, this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message
ineffective.]

[CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.]

[CFJ 1861 (called 8 January 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer to
em.]

[CFJ 1782 (called 4 November 2007): Referring to a player by the name
of an office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a
person, if there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.]

[CFJ 1840 (called 20 December 2007): A proper noun that has not been
explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is not
implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.]

[CFJ 1580 (called 12 January 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a
message, other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers,
can render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding
step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): HTML encoding (including
numerical character entity encoding) does not render a message
ineffective for unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a
header.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): An email message does not need
the RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be
interpreted in the MIME way.]

[CFJ 1536 (called 13 March 2005): The phrase "AOL!" is not a
sufficiently clear synonym for "Me too!".]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): A contract can redefine a
rule-defined term in its own way, and the contract's definition will
then apply in situations governed by the contract.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a
meaning by custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does
not unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
meaning.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Mentioning a URI, without
surrounding text stating its significance, does not incorporate
anything identified by that URI into the message that mentions the
URI.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Character sequences within a URI
by default have no significance other than their functional role as
part of the URI.]

[CFJ 2258 (called 6 November 2008): Changes in whitespace are also
inconsequential.]

Rule 2152/5 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      4. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      5. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rule in question.

      6. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be
         understood and carefully weighed.

[CFJ 1990 (called 7 June 2008): "Allowed" may refer to either
possibility or permissibility depending on context.]

[CFJs 2120-2121 (called 4 August 2008): A requirement of the form
'within <time limit>, a player SHALL <action> by announcement' means
that the player CAN perform the action, and SHALL do so within the
time limit.]

[CFJ 2230 (called 16 October 2008): In a statement of the form "an
action that X may take", 'may' generally means 'might', i.e. CAN.]

[CFJ 2282 (called 19 November 2008): To state that an entity "MUST"
have certain properties refers to possibility, not legality.]

[CFJ 2414 (called 14 March 2009): A rule of the form "X SHOULD be
interpreted as Y" does not allow players to bypass the interpretation
by failing to perform the described action.]

Rule 1023/27 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrases "in a timely fashion" and "as soon as possible"
          mean "within seven days".  A requirement to perform an
          action at an exact instant (e.g.  "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but
          not "in the same message", is instead interpreted as a
          requirement to perform that action in a timely fashion after
          that instant.

      (b) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

          (5) A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
              which at least one person won the game.  When used as a
              period of time, a "game" is the period of time between a
              pivot and the next pivot.

          These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
          "within <number> days after <event>").

Rule 1769/7 (Power=3)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event (including the
      time limit to perform an action) upon the time of another event,
      and

      a) that other event occurs during a Holiday, then the time at
         which that Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose
         of determining the time of the future event.

      b) the future event would occur during a Holiday, then the
         future event occurs 72 hours after the end of that Holiday
         instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require events to be
      performed before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The registration of a player is an
event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1480 (called 5 January 2004): An automatic event specified to
occur at regular calendar intervals, for example quarterly, happens at
its specified time even if that is during a holiday.]

Rule 2146/1 (Power=2)
Indices

      Indices are elements of the extended real numbers, which is a
      total order consisting of the real numbers plus a minimum
      element, called negative infinity, and a maximum element, called
      positive infinity or unanimity.

      The ratio of a positive index to zero is positive infinity.  The
      ratio of a negative index to zero is negative infinity.  The
      ratio of zero to any index is zero.

Rule 2162/1 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes the value of each instance of
         that switch whose value is not its default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

Rule 478/29 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
      publicity are secured.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each forum with non-Foreign
      publicity, sufficient instructions for players to receive
      messages there.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A
      person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
      message,.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages
      (including sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear
      in the message, unless otherwise specified.

[CFJs 1451-1452 (called 6 March 2003): A message that is split into
multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct the
single message.]

[CFJ 752 (called 13 March 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813 (called 22 October 1995): A Player need not prove that e can
receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831 (called 10 November 1995): The Date: header of a message is
not necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 2205 (called 2 October 2008): A message takes effect at exactly
one of the times date-stamped on it; selecting which one is a matter
of game custom.]

[CFJ 2212 (called 7 October 2008): An IRC channel is a forum.]

[CFJ 2211 (called 7 October 2008): It is generally possible for an IRC
channel to be a public forum.

[CFJ 2214 (called 7 October 2008): Some IRC messages, such as NICK,
are sent to all members of an IRC channel but are not sent via that
channel.]

[CFJ 866 (called 8 April 1996): A message is "received" when the
message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1314 (called 15 August 2001): If a message sent to a public forum
is rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
sent via a public forum.]

[CFJ 1905 (called 7 February 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message
has not been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to
receive messages via the forum receive it.]

[CFJ 1888 (called 31 January 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion
Forum, or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not
qualify as sending it to all players.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1784 (called 5 November 2007): An undescriptive or misleading
subject line does not deprive the message body of effect.]

[CFJ 1880 (called 22 January 2008): A phrase that would, in the
message body, cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not
have such an effect if it appears in the subject line.]

[CFJ 1761 (called 30 September 2007): Publishing part of a message is
a different action from publishing the whole message.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1719 (called 12 August 2007): A player can, if e intends, have
public messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that
allows all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific
approval.]

[CFJs 1833-1834 (called 18 December 2007): A player can, by
contractual arrangement, grant another player the capacity to act by
announcement on eir behalf.]

[CFJ 1893 (called 3 February 2008): A non-consensual non-contractual
arrangement cannot grant a player the capacity to act by announcement
on behalf of another.]

[CFJ 2397 (caled 3 March 2009): A player can grant or revoke
permission at will for another player to act by announcement on eir
behalf.]

[CFJ 2322 (called 24 December 2008): The ability to act on behalf can
be created by any willful agreement.]

[CFJ 1336 (called 13 December 2001): A public statement that one
wishes to perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
constitute an announcement that performs that action.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

[CFJ 1584 (called 24 February 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 August 2007):
Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of instances
of "I do X".]

[CFJ 1774 (called 1 November 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where
X is something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
abusive.  The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
successful.]

[CFJ 1775 (called 1 November 2007): If an announcement of the form "I
do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do
X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have
the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
M.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): An appropriate announcement will
accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
impossible.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): A message-based action cannot be
retroactive.]

[CFJ 1971 (called 22 May 2008): An announcement with a general
disclaimer as to its contents cannot fulfill a requirement to report
information, but it may successfully cause game actions to be taken if
the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
contents.]

[CFJ 2133 (called 9 August 2008): A disclaimed statement cannot cause
an action to be taken by announcement.]

[CFJ 2112 (called 23 July 2008): An action is only taken by
announcement if the Rules define it as such; e.g., posting an
objection to a dependent action is not an action taken by
announcement.]

[CFJ 2151 (called 5 September 2008): Some unregulated actions, such as
celebrating and revealing things, can be taken by announcement.]

[CFJ 2086 (called 15 July 2008): Message-based actions are always
taken in some order, never precisely simultaneously, possibly unless
otherwise stated.]

[CFJ 2179 (called 23 September 2008): An message-based action can be
taken even if its sender cannot be identified.]

[CFJ 2221 (called 13 October 2008): When an action is specified as
"can do X in order to do Y", and a player does X without specifying
intent to do Y, e does not do Y.]

[CFJ 2238 (called 22 October 2008): The requirement of unambiguous
specification applies to the parameters of an action.]

[CFJ 2363 (called 1 February 2009): "X can do Y by doing Z" does not
imply that X can do Z.]

[CFJ 2441 (called 6 April 2009): Due to a limitation of the mailing
list archives, attaching a message with a particular text does not
count as publishing that text.]

Rule 1728/30 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

      A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
      perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
      methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

       1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
          greater than 8.
       2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.
       3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
          with a minimum of 1.
       4) With Notice.

      thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
      of the following are true:

       a) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
          action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
          method(s) (including the value of N for each method), at
          most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
          objections or notice) at least four days earlier.

       b) At least one of the following is true:

            1) The performer is the initiator.

            2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
               to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
               performer.

            3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
               action depends on support, the performer has supported
               the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
               does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
               it.

       c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
          other rules.

       d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
          given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
          all those conditions are met.

      The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
      depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
      objections.

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): The method of dependent action need
not be described exactly: an approximate but inexact description
suffices, as does the rule-defined term.]

[CFJ 1802 (called 19 November 2007): The phrase "by Agoran Support" is
not an unambiguous description of a method of dependent action.]

Rule 2288/2 (Power=3)
Induction

      If a person CAN perform an action by announcement, e CAN perform
      it with N support, without N objections, with N Agoran Consent,
      or with notice, where N is a number appropriate for that form of
      dependent action.

      If a person CAN perform an action with notice, e CAN perform it
      without N objections, where N is an appropriate number.

      If a person CAN perform an action with M support, e CAN
      perform it with N support, where N is an appropriate number
      greater than M.

      If a person CAN perform an action without M objections, e CAN
      perform it without N objections, where N is an appropriate
      number less than M.

      If a person CAN perform an action via multiple different means
      of dependent actions, e CAN perform that action via multiple of
      them at the same time.

      If a player CAN perform an action with 0 support, then e CAN
      perform it by announcement.

Rule 2124/16 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has
      publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for
      an announcement of intent to perform the action.  An Objector to
      a dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent
      to perform the action.

      The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action
      are, by default, all first-class players, subject to
      modification by the document authorizing the dependent action.
      However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the Executor of
      the announcement of intent is not eligible to support it.

      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      if and only if:

      (1) if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then
          it has fewer than N objectors;

      (2) if the action is to be performed With N supporters, then it
          has N or more supporters; and

      (3) if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then
          the ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or
          the action has at least one supporter and no objectors.

      The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections,
      and an objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24
      hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with the intent.

      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the
      same type of response.

Rule 2166/16 (Power=2)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a rule or contest
      (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely because
      its backing document defines its existence.

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
      an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a class
      of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred
      to an entity outside that class, and is transferred to the Lost
      and Found Department if it is owned by an entity outside that
      class.  If an asset is owned by the Lost and Found department
      any player CAN transfer or destroy it without objection.

      The Lost and Found department may own any asset, and have assets
      transferred to and from it, regardless of the asset's backing
      document or any Rule, Rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document.  That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class
      and their owners.  This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying.

      An asset whose backing document is not a rule generally CAN be
      created by its recordkeepor by announcement, subject to
      modification by its backing document.  To "gain" an asset is to
      have it created in one's possession; to "award" an asset to an
      entity is to create it in that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
      announcement, and an asset owned by the Lost and Found
      Department generally CAN be destroyed by its recordkeepor by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing document.
      To "lose" (syn. "spend") an asset is to have it destroyed from
      one's possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to
      destroy it from that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be transferred by its owner to another
      entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document.  Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.  The Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ) of each currency is
      one.

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): The self-ratifying asset
report is the complete list of ownerships of assets of that class; a
partial list does not self-ratify.]

[CFJ 1850 (called 22 December 2007): The general ability of the
recordkeepor to create assets does not include an ability to determine
who possesses them when created, so they are necessarily owned by the
Lost and Found Department [at the time of CFJ 1850, the Bank] upon
creation.]

[CFJ 1910 (called 10 March 2008): When an existing entity is defined
as an asset, the change of its owner from "undefined" to the Lost and
Found Department [Bank at the time of CFJ 1910] counts as a transfer,
and fails if the Lost and Found Department is outside of the class of
objects that can own the entity.]

[CFJ 2176 (called 22 September 2008): Entities may be fungible even if
not defined as such by this rule.]

[CFJ 2309 (called 11 December 2008): If two separate documents attempt
to define an asset with the same name, they refer to the same entity,
but the entity is not an asset.]

Offices
      A category concerning administrative positions held by persons
      within the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/32 (Power=2)
Offices

      An office is a role defined as such by the rules.  Each office
      is either vacant (default) or filled (held) by exactly one
      player.  An officer is the holder of an office, who may be
      referred to by the name of that office.

      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it.  All others are elected.

      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant.  Any player CAN cause an office to
      become vacant without objection.

[CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning
of the term "office", in the sense meant by rule 754, but rather
references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
offices as thus defined.]

[CFJ 1702 (called 12 July 2007): A requirement to submit something to
an officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is
vacant at the time.]

Rule 2143/14 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each office:

      a) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that office's
         weekly duties, then the holder of that office SHALL perform
         it at least once each week.  If any information is defined by
         the rules as part of that office's weekly report, then the
         holder of that office SHALL maintain all such information,
         and the publication of all such information is part of that
         office's weekly duties.

      b) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that office's
         monthly duties, then the holder of that office SHALL perform
         it at least once each month.  If any information is defined
         by the rules as part of that office's monthly report, then
         the holder of that office SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of that office's monthly duties.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of an office's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of its weekly
      report.  Failure of the holder of an office to perform any duty
      required of that office within the allotted time is the Class-2
      crime of Tardiness.

      While performing weekly or monthly duties or publishing weekly
      or monthly reports, officers SHALL NOT publish information that
      is inaccurate or misleading.

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must
      line up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.  Publishing a
      report that deviates from these regulations is the Class 2 Crime
      of Making My Eyes Bleed.

[CFJ 2392 (called 27 February 2009): Publishing an intentionally
incomplete report does not satisfy this rule's requirement to publish
a report.]

Rule 2160/7 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if all of the
      following are true:

        (a) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
            holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
            office is vacant, would so require if the office were
            filled).  This requirement is fulfilled by the deputy
            performing the action.

        (b) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
            performed has expired, or the office is vacant.

        (c) If the office is filled, then the deputy announced between
            two and fourteen days earlier that e intended to deputise
            for that office for the purposes of the particular action.

        (d) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
            other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

[CFJ 1776 (called 1 November 2007): A requirement to perform an
action, for the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication
from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules.]

[CFJ 2400 (called 6 March 2009): Deputisation is generally treated as
if the deputy gained the office immediately before the action, and
lost it immediately after.]

Rule 2154/34 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office
      for which no election is already in progress

       a) by announcement, if e is the IADoP, or the office is vacant
          or assumed, or no election has been initiated for the office
          within 90 days before the announcement;

       b) with 4 Supporters, otherwise.

      When an election is initiated, the current holder of the office
      (if any) is initially considered to have been nominated and have
      accepted.

      During the first four days of the election (the nomination
      period), any player CAN by announcement nominate one or more
      active players.

      As soon as possible after the nomination period ends, the IADoP
      SHALL initiate an Agoran decision to determine the new
      officeholder. For this decision:

       1) The valid options are the active players (hereafter the
          candidates) who, during the election,

            a) received and accepted a nomination for the office
               before the decision was initiated (self-nomination
               constitutes acceptance), and

            b) did not decline a nomination for the office.

          The set of candidates can change after the decision is
          initiated.

       2) The eligible voters are the active first-class players.

       3) Each eligible voter's voting limit is one.

       4) If there are no valid options for the Decision, the IADoP
          SHALL, in place of initiating the decision, announce this
          fact, ending the election.  If there is exactly one valid
          option for the Decision, the IADoP SHALL, in place of
          initiating the Decision, announce the valid option (the
          candidate), thus installing that candidate into the office
          and ending the election.

      Upon the resolution of this decision, its outcome (if a
      candidate) is installed into the office, and the election ends.

Rule 2276/3 (Power=2)
Assumption of Vacant Offices

      Assumption is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP
      with values Postulated (default) and Assumed. Changes to
      Assumption are secured.  An active first-class player can make
      emself the holder of an elected office by announcement, provided
      that the office is either vacant or Assumed.

      Upon doing so, the office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When the holder of an office ceases to be an active player, the
      office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When a person comes to hold an office, or would come to hold an
      office if e did not hold it already, by a means other than the
      one provided by this Rule, then the Assumption of that office is
      flipped to Postulated.

      If a player has held an Assumed office continuously since the
      last time it was Postulated, e can flip its Assumption to
      Postulated by announcement.

Rule 2138/12 (Power=1)
The Interplanetary Associate Director of Personnel

      The Interplanetary Associate Director of Personnel (IADoP) is an
      office; its holder is responsible for keeping track of officers
      and reports.

      The IADoP's report includes the following:

      a) The holder of each office.
      b) The date on which each holder last came to hold that office.
      c) The date when the most recent nomination period for that
         office began.
      d) The date when that office's reports were last published.

      The portion of a public message purporting to be an IADoP's
      report that lists the holder of each office is self-ratifying.

[CFJ 1672 (called 18 May 2007): The Interplanetary Associate Director
of Personnel is the Director of Personnel.]

[Cross-references (1 March 2008): the IADoP's duties are:
  * hold election for office where contested (rule 2154)
  * report officeholding (rule 2138)]

      gamestate had been minimally modified to make the ratified
      document as true and accurate as possible.  Such a modification
      cannot add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules,
      and it cannot include a rule change unless the ratified document
      purports to include the text, title, and/or power of the rule
      being changed.  If no such modification is possible, or
      multiple substantially distinct possible modifications would be
      equally appropriate, the ratification fails.

      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be
      ratified; however, if such a document can be divided into a
      summary section and a main section, where the only purpose of
      the summary section is to summarize information in the main
      section, and the main section is internally consistent,
      ratification of the document proceeds as if it contained only
      the main section.

      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g.
      a report's date of last ratification) is excluded from
      ratification.

      Ratifying a public document is secured.

fictions, but does not always.]

Rule 2202/4 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
      specifying its scope. If that document is an official report or
      a substantial portion thereof, until such a time as that report
      or portion is again ratified, the date and scope of the
      ratification become a part of the report.

      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal,
      amendment, enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to
      ratification) incorrect document when a corrected document could
      be produced with reasonable effort, unless the general nature of
      the document's error and reason for ratifying it is clearly and
      plainly described in the announcement of intent.  Such
      ratification or announcement of intent to ratify is the Class-8
      Crime of Endorsing Forgery.

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): Ratification of an official
document affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to
be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list
of players.]

[CFJ 2289 (called 25 November 2008): Ratification Without Objection of
a value inseparable from another value may change the latter value

Rule 2201/5 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:

       a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
          interpretation.

       b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
          publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required
          to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of
          the following as soon as possible:

              i) Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
             ii) Publish a revision.
            iii) Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the
                 claim (if the subject is actually a matter of law),
                 or cite a relevant existing inquiry case.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying
document [at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran
decision] must explicitly identify the document, either individually
or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some
aspect of it.]

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): A challenge to any part of
a self-ratifying document prevents ratification of all parts of it.]

Rule 693/14 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:

          (a) Initiation of the decision.
          (b) Voting of the people.
          (c) Resolution of the decision.

      When submitting a ballot, a player can select PRESENT (syn.
      ABSTAIN) rather than one of the options provided by the
      decision. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a ballot cast
      for PRESENT is considered to be a valid ballot, but, unless
      specified otherwise, does not count as a valid option.

Rule 107/13 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) A clear indication of the options available.

      (d) The identity of the vote collector.

      (e) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
          parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  The minimum voting period for a decision with
      at least two options is seven days.  The vote collector for a
      decision with less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting
      period by announcement, if it has not ended already, and
      provided that e resolves the decision in the same message.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
the information required in the notice need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1743 (called 18 September 2007): If the notice does not mention
voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the
rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
describes the class of eligible voters.]

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): Information that is explicitly
presented in the notice takes precedence over any information that
would be implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate
and the implicit information would have been accurate.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 683/15 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision, and the submitter is an eligible voter at the
          time of submission.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.  ("Changing" a vote is equivalent to
          retracting it and casting a vote with the new value.)

      Among the otherwise-valid votes on an Agoran decision, only the
      first N submitted by each entity are valid, where N is the
      entity's voting limit on that decision.  The voting limit of an
      entity that is not an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is
      zero.  The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
      decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

[CFJs 1852-1853 (called 23 December 2007): Claiming to submit more
votes than ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the
making of a false statement.]

Rule 2127/6 (Power=1)
Conditional Votes

      If a vote on an Agoran decision is submitted conditionally (e.g.
      "FOR if <X> is true, otherwise AGAINST"), then the selected
      option is evaluated based on the value of the condition(s) at
      the end of the voting period, and is clearly specified if and
      only if the value of the condition(s) can be reasonably
      determined (without circularity or paradox) from information
      reasonably available during the voting period.  If the option
      cannot be clearly identified, a vote of PRESENT is cast.

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites.

[CFJ 2449 (called 14 April 2009): For an endorsement or denouncement,
the identity of the voter in question is part of the condition.]

Rule 2280/0 (Power=3)
Implicit Votes

      When an eligible voter on an Agoran decision attempts to cast
      ballots without explicitly specifying the number of ballots to
      be cast (e.g. "FOR" instead of "FOR*1" or "FOR*3"), e casts a
      number of ballots equal to eir voting limit on that decision.

Rule 2168/6 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
      period for that decision is instead doubled, provided this has
      not already happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and
      CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving it
      constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
      first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or
      if the decision is whether to adopt a proposal and no voter
      (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

Rule 208/8 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the option selected by Agora.  If
      it was required to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it as soon
      as possible after the end of the voting period.  To be valid,
      this announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if
          there was more than one valid option, provides a tally of
          the voters' valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

[CFJ 1711 (called 1 August 2007): If a purported resolution notice

[CFJ 1822 (called 4 December 2007): If a purported resolution notice
includes invalid votes in its tally of votes, this makes the notice
invalid.]

Rule 955/17 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      After an Agoran Decision's voting period ends, it has an outcome
      (syn. "the <appropriate noun> chosen by Agora").

      (a) If there is more than one available option, and the number
          of distinct voters who submitted valid ballots is less than
          quorum, then the outcome is FAILED QUORUM, regardless of the
          remainder of this rule.  Otherwise, the decision achieved
          quorum.

      (b) If the decision has an adoption index, then the voting index
          is the ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of
          AGAINST.  If the voting index is greater than 1, and greater
          than or equal to the decision's adoption index, then the
          outcome is ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

      (c) Otherwise, the outcome is the option with the most votes.
          In case of a tie, the vote collector SHALL select one of the
          leaders as the outcome. If there are no options, the outcome
          is null.

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is
determined at the time the vote collector makes the calculations
described in rule 955.]

Rule 879/27 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Quorum for an Agoran decision is N/3 (where N is the number of
      eligible voters with a positive voting limit on that decision),
      rounded up, with a minimum of five (unless this is greater than
      N, in which case quorum is N).

[CFJ 1562 (called 3 May 2005): A cancelled vote on a Proposal does not
count towards quorum.]

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision
changes as the set of eligible voters changes.]

Rule 2034/6 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
      existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is
      wholly without effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      This does not prevent amendment of the rules governing the
      validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
      changed in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
      does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

      A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
      constitutes self-ratifying claims that

       a) such a decision existed,
       b) it was resolved as indicated, and
       c) (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
          proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.

======================================================================
Proposals
      A category concerning the primary and plenipotent system by
      which changes are made to the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/30 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a fixed body of text which has been made into a
      proposal using a process specifically described in the Rules.
      When a person creates a proposal, e SHOULD ensure that it
      specifies one or more changes to the gamestate.  Except as
      prohibited by other rules, a proposal that takes effect CAN, as
      part of its effect, apply the changes that it specifies.  If the
      proposal cannot make some such changes, this does not preclude
      the other changes from taking place.

      A player CAN create a proposal by publishing ("submitting") a
      body of text and an associated title with a clear indication
      that it is intended to become a proposal, which places the
      proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The author (syn. proposer) of a
      proposal is the player who submitted it.  A player CAN remove
      (syn. retract, withdraw) a proposal e authored from the Proposal
      Pool by announcement.

      A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute a
      Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.  Removing
      a proposal from the Pool by a means other than initiating an
      Agoran Decision to adopt it is secured.

      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any active player to distribute, then any player
      CAN distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.

      A co-author of a proposal is a person (other than its author)
      unambiguously identified as such by its author when it was
      submitted.

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9.  It may be set by the proposer at the time of
      submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      The adoption index of this decision is set to the adoption index
      of the proposal at the initiation of the decision. Changing the
      adoption index of the decision is secured with a power threshold
      of 2.  The vote collector for this decision is the Assessor.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.

      A proposal with a decision on which the option selected by Agora
      is not ADOPTED does not take effect, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change;
      this does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified
      areas of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from
      taking effect (its no-effect clause is generally interpreted as
      applying only to the rest of the proposal).

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1717 (called 8 August 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient
to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): "AGAINT" is a variant spelling of
"AGAINST", not a customary synonym for "FOR", despite its former
private usage with the latter meaning.]

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

[CFJ 1781 (called 4 November 2007): Proposal distribution is not
governed by this rule, so for the promotor to distribute a proposal
that is not in the proposal pool is not a violation of this rule.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): It is possible for a proposal to
have retroactive effect.]

[CFJ 2162 (called 14 September 2008): The retroactive effect of a
proposal cannot actually alter the past.]

[CFJ 2163 (called 14 September 2008): There is no possible proposal
text that would cause a proposal to take effect without being
adopted.]

[CFJ 2259 (called 6 November 2008): The possibility of the
instantaneous effects of a proposal are governed by the rules.]

Rule 1607/30 (Power=2)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      Distributability is switch possessed by proposals in the
      proposal pool, tracked by the Promotor, with values
      Distributable (default) and Undistributable.

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.  In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL,
      as part of eir weekly duties, distribute any proposal that is in
      the Proposal Pool and was Distributable at the beginning of that
      Agoran week.  The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute an
      Undistributable proposal.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.

[CFJ 1546 (called 14 April 2005), CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a
proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted
proposal if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of
the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal
distribution of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor creates a new
proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a
proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential
differences), then the author of the new proposal is the author of the
proposal on which it is based.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor accidentally
creates a new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is
seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
proposal has no author.]

[Cross-references (2 August 2007): the Promotor's duties are:
  * not distribute proposals during holiday (rule 1769)
  * distribute proposals (rule 1607)
  * manage ID numbers of distributed proposals (rule 1607)
  * report proposal pool (rule 1607)]

Rule 1950/21 (Power=3)
Voting on Democratic Decisions

      An Agoran decision with an adoption index is a Democratic
      decision.

      An Agoran decision with an adoption index has the following
      essential parameters:

      a) Its adoption index.
      b) Its author (and co-authors, if any).

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the available
      options are FOR and AGAINST.

      The eligible voters on a democratic decision are those entities
      that were active first-class players at the start of its voting
      period.  The voting limit of each eligible voter on a democratic
      decision is one.

Adjudication
      A category concerning the judicial system by which matters of
      controversy are resolved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/11 (Power=2)
Judicial Cases Generally

      A judicial case, also known as a call for judgement (CFJ), is a
      procedure to settle a matter of controversy.

      Each judicial case has exactly one subclass, with particular
      features as defined by other rules.  Subclasses of judicial case
      exist only as defined by the rules.  Defining a subclass of
      judicial case is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  A
      judicial case's subclass CAN be specified by its initiator, or
      otherwise defaults to inquiry.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office, responsible for
      managing judicial activity.  The CotC's report includes the
      status of all judicial cases that either require a judge or have
      at least one applicable judicial question that has no judgement.

      Judicial cases (other than appeal cases, which have historically
      been identified by reference to the prior case) have ID numbers,
      to be assigned by the Clerk of the Courts.

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[CFJ 1355 (called 28 April 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so
it is possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.]

[Cross-references (28 May 2008): the Clerk of the Courts' duties
are:
  * not assign judges during holiday (rule 1769)
  * report open judicial cases (rule 991)
  * manage ID numbers of non-appeal judicial cases (rule 991)
  * refuse excess CFJ (rule 2175)
  * assign judge to judicial case (rule 1868)
  * not assign a poorly qualified judge (rule 1868)
  * track player posture (rule 1871)
  * rotate the bench (rule 1871)
  * recuse tardy judge (rule 2158)]

      case.  Judicial questions arise only as defined by the rules.
      Defining a judicial question is secured, with a power threshold
      of 1.7.

      At any time, each judicial question is either inapplicable
      (default) or applicable.  This is not a persistent status, but
      is evaluated instantaneously.

      At any time, each judicial question is either open (default),
      suspended, or has exactly one judgement.  This is a persistent
      status that changes only according to the rules.  The possible
      types of judgement for a judicial question depend on the type of
      question.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, its case
      requires a judge.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as
      possible, unless e is recused from the case before the time
      limit for doing so has expired.  A judge SHOULD NOT assign an
      inappropriate judgement to any judicial question.  A judgement
      is valid and/or appropriate only as defined by the rules.
      Defining these things is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.
      If more than one judgement is valid and appropriate, then the
      choice between them is left to the judge's discretion.

      When a judicial question on a non-appeal case is applicable and
      open, and its judge has violated a time limit to assign a
      judgement to it, or is not an active player, the Clerk of the
      Courts SHALL recuse that judge with cause by announcement as
      soon as possible; however, this requirement is waived if the
      judge assigns a judgement to it first.

[CFJ 1804 (called 19 November 2007): A judge should give the judgement
that e believes is appropriate, and if e does so in good faith then e
can be EXCUSED if the judgement is later found to have been
inappropriate.]

[CFJ 1871 (called 15 January 2008): The appropriateness of a judgement
is determined solely by the facts of the case, and is independent of
the reasoning used by a judge to decide on the judgement.]

Rule 591/32 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      Inquiry cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  An inquiry
      case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a particular
      statement.  An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any first-class
      person, by announcement which includes the statement to be
      inquired into.  (Including a yes/no question is equivalent to
      including a statement that the answer to that question is yes,
      and for such a case, YES and NO are synonymous with the
      judgements TRUE and FALSE respectively.)

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are
      as follows, based on the truth or falsity of the statement at
      the time the inquiry case was initiated:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
        don't actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
        from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
        judicial question which was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
        UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose

      * MALFORMED, appropriate if the text identified by the initiator
        as the statement cannot be parsed as a single statement in the
        ordinary-language sense; however, a compound statement (e.g.
        "X and Y", "X or Y") counts as a single statement

      Players SHOULD take the judgement of the question in an inquiry
      case, and the reasoning by which it was reached, into account
      when attempting to determine what is possible and/or legal in
      future play (including when making future judgements); but the
      judgement does not directly affect the veracity of the
      statement.  The Rulekeepor is ENCOURAGED to annotate rules to
      draw attention to relevant inquiry case judgements.

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): A question cannot generally take
the place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.]

[CFJ 1903 (called 6 February 2008): The question-statement equivalence
established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the subject
of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public
knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine
it.]

[CFJ 1482 (called 10 February 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement
logically depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called
CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this
as a situation of insufficient information being available.]

[CFJ 1744 (called 18 September 2007): It is not the job of the judge
to hunt down or request the information that would be required to
render a substantive judgement.]

[CFJ 1771 (called 28 October 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around
the interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is entitled
to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
available.]

[CFJ 1732 (called 23 August 2007): If a particular player holds a
particular office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player
holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that
office.]

[CFJ 2281 (called 19 November 2008): For the purposes of determining
the validity of an inquiry case, the term "statement" should be
interpreted loosely.]

Rule 2230/17 (Power=2)
Notices of Violation

      A player CAN publish a Notice of Violation (NoV) with N support,
      where N is the one half of the number of valid NoVs e previously
      published during the same week, rounded down. An NoV is invalid
      if it lacks any of the following information, and the lack is
      correctly identified within one week after the NoV is published:
       (a) The identity of the Accused;
       (b) The allegedly illegal action/inaction in question;
       (c) The Rule that was allegedly broken;
       (d) If the Rules specify exactly one Class-N Crime (where N is
           a positive integer) as being associated with the alleged
           breach, then the name of that Crime and the value of N;
           otherwise, the Power of the Rule that was allegedly broken.

      Knowingly issuing a NoV with incorrect information is ILLEGAL,
      and the Class-4 Crime of Libel.

      A NoV is valid if and only if:
        (1) it clearly specifies the required information for a NoV;
        (2) no previous valid NoV specified substantially identical
            information (i.e. the same violation for the same specific
            act).
        (3) when a crime is named, the crime is specified within the
            Rules.

      Neither a NoV's incorrectness (i.e. whether its allegation is
      false) nor its unfairness (i.e. whether the punishment resulting
      from leaving it Uncontested would be manifestly unfair according
      to the guidance of the Rules) affects its validity.

      As soon as possible after a player makes an announcement that is
      reasonably recognizable as an attempt to issue such a NoV, the
      Herald SHALL announce whether the NoV was valid.  Such an
      announcement is self-ratifying.  Affirming the validity of the
      NoV does not in itself certify the correctness of the
      allegation.

      A valid NoV is initially Uncontested unless a Crime is named,
      Contested otherwise.  Within four days after the publication of
      an Uncontested NoV, any player CAN make it Contested by
      announcement; a player SHOULD do so if e believes it is
      incorrect and/or unfair.  An Uncontested NoV becomes Contested
      upon the initiation of a judicial case questioning its
      incorrectness and/or unfairness (but not merely by questioning
      its validity).

      Valid NOVs have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Herald.

Rule 1504/49 (Power=2)
Criminal Cases

      Criminal cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  Any
      first-class person can initiate a criminal case by an
      announcement calling for judgement on the circumstances
      surrounding a specified valid Notice of Violation alleging a
      rules breach by a single entity (the Accused).  The initiator
      and each member of the Accused's basis are unqualified to be
      assigned as judge of the case.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on culpability, which is
      applicable at all times following the call for judgement.  The
      valid judgements for this question are:

      * GUILTY, appropriate if the judge finds, beyond a reasonable
        doubt, that ALL of the following are true:
       (a) the Accused breached the specified rule via the specified
           act;
       (b) the breach occurred within 90 days prior to the case being
           initiated;
       (c) judgement has not already been reached in another criminal
           case, or punishment already applied through another
           uncontested notice of violation, with the same Accused, the
           same rule, and substantially the same alleged act;
       (d) the Accused could have reasonably believed that the alleged
           act did violate the specified rule;
       (e) the Accused could have reasonably avoided committing the
           breach without committing a different breach of equal or
           greater severity.

      * NOT GUILTY, appropriate if GUILTY is not appropriate.  In
        delivering this verdict, the judge SHOULD indicate which of
        the sub-requirements for a finding of guilty were not found to
        be true beyond a reasonable doubt.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on sentencing, which is
      applicable if the question on culpability is applicable and has
      a judgement of GUILTY.  If a criminal case has an applicable
      question on sentencing which has a judgement, the Accused is
      hereafter known as the ninny, the judgement in the question on
      sentencing is known as the sentence, and the sentence is in
      effect.

      The valid sentences are:

      * DISCHARGE, appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances, if
        any available non-null punishment would be manifestly unjust.
        Has no effect.

      * APOLOGY with a set of up to ten prescribed words (the empty
        set if none is explicitly specified), appropriate for rule
        breaches of small consequence.  When in effect, the ninny
        SHALL as soon as possible publish a formal apology of at least
        200 words, including all the prescribed words, explaining eir
        error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement.
        Failure to do so is a Class-3 Crime of Failure to Apologize.

      * FINE with an amount of one class of asset, appropriate for
        rule breaches of small consequence.  An amount is only valid
        if the currency's backing document binds the ninny (the Rules
        are considered to bind all players) or the ninny has this
        amount of the asset, and the backing document specifies a
        maximum FINE amount, and the amount is no greater than the
        maximum.  When in effect, the ninny SHALL, as soon as
        possible, either destroy this amount of eir asset or transfer
        it to the Lost and Found Department. The ninny is only obliged
        to perform one destruction or transfer per question on
        sentencing, even if sentences of this type are assigned more
        than once or go into effect more than once.

      * COMMUNITY SERVICE with a set of up to five tasks (the
        prescribed tasks) that the ninny CAN reasonably and legally
        perform, appropriate for rule breaches of moderate consequence
        if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably correlated
        with the consequences of performing the tasks, and especially
        if any other available non-null punishment would be either
        unjust or insufficient.  The balance between compensatory and
        punitive service is left to the judge's discretion.  While a
        sentence of this type is in effect, the ninny SHALL perform
        the prescribed tasks (as soon as possible, unless a different
        time limit is specified).

      * TIME OUT with a number of days between 7 and 21. The ninny
        becomes inactive, and SHALL NOT become active for the number
        of days specified, as long as the sentence remains in effect.

      Players SHOULD NOT create rules defining Crimes of a Class
      greater than 14.

[CFJ 1720 (called 12 August 2007): Where a criminal charge is
expressed in the form "violating rule NNNN by XXX", the alleged act
for the purposes of the rules is only "XXX".]

[CFJ 1845 (called 20 December 2007): Mentioning a rule in a section
labelled "arguments" in a message that attempts to initiate a criminal
case does not constitute clearly specifying the rule allegedly
breached.]

[CFJs 1857-1858 (called 31 December 2007): Ignorance of the law is not
appropriate grounds for a verdict of UNAWARE.]

[CFJ 1804 (called 19 November 2007): A verdict of EXCUSED is
appropriate where a person mistakenly, in good faith, believes that
eir action is legal when it is not.]

[CFJs 1808-1809 (called 28 November 2007): Sentencing a ninny to
"APOLOGY" without explicitly giving a set of prescribed words
constitutes sentencing the ninny to APOLOGY with the empty set of
prescribed words.]

[CFJ 1846 (called 20 December 2007): For the purposes of prescribed
words, words do not need to be a standard part of the language.]

[CFJ 1924 (called 10 April 2008): A duration need not be a fixed
amount of time.]

Rule 2277/2 (Power=2)
Appeals of Criminal Cases

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a criminal
      case within the past week CAN be initiated by the accused by
      announcement.

      Unless otherwise specified, an appeal of a judgement in a
      criminal case is assumed to be appealing the question of
      culpability.

      When a judgement on a criminal case's question of culpability is
      suspended, the judgement (if any) on its question of sentencing
      is also suspended.  Afterward, if the first judgement is
      assigned again, then so is the second.

Judicial Arguments and Evidence

      Each of the following participants in a judicial case SHOULD
      present such arguments and/or evidence (explicitly labeled)
      relevant to that case as e is reasonably able to collect:

      1) The initiator, when initiating the case.

      2) For a criminal case, the defendant, during the pre-trial
         phase.

      3) For an equity case, the parties to the agreement in question,
         during the pre-trial phase.

      4) The judge, when delivering judgement.

      When submitting arguments and/or evidence, a player SHOULD
      classify matters of legal interpretation as arguments, and
      matters of fact as evidence.

Rule 2157/6 (Power=1.7)
Judicial Panels

      A judicial panel is a structure whereby a group of two or more
      persons (its members) act together for the purpose of judging
      judicial cases.  A judicial panel's membership cannot change,
      and if two panels have the same membership then they are the
      same panel.  Judicial panels exist implicitly, without any
      specific act of formation.

      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous Support of the panel's other members.  By
      this mechanism a judicial panel can act, in situations where the
      rules state that an action is performed by sending a message.
      The rules may specify other mechanisms by which the judicial
      panel CAN act.

      A judicial panel can incur obligations.  The members of a panel
      SHALL act collectively to ensure that the panel satisfies all of
      its obligations.

Motions to Reconsider

      If a non-Appeals judicial question (1) has a judgement that has
      been in effect for less than seven days and not been appealed,
      and (2) has not had a Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any
      time while it has been assigned to its current judge, then any
      Player CAN file a Motion to Reconsider the question with 2
      Support.

      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the question is
      rendered open again.  A player who files such a Motion SHOULD
      include arguments as to why the question needs reconsideration,
      and such arguments become part of the record of the case.

Rule 911/40 (Power=1.7)
Appeal Cases

      Appeal cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  An appeal case's
      purpose is to determine the appropriateness of a judgement that
      has been assigned to a judicial question, and make remedy if the
      judgement was poorly chosen.  The assignment of judgement being
      questioned (appealed against, or appealed) is referred to as the
      prior assignment; the word "prior" in this rule is used to refer
      to the circumstances of the prior assignment.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case within the past two weeks CAN be initiated by any player
      with 2 support.  However, rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      an appeal CANNOT be initiated concerning an assignment caused by
      a judgement in an appeal case, nor an assignment for which an
      appeal has already been initiated.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of max(3,1+2*R) members
      (where R is the rank of the prior case), where each of the
      members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior case
      and none is the prior judge.  If possible, the CotC SHALL assign
      a panel where each of the members is well qualified to be
      assigned as judge of the prior case.

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition are of the form
      "<action> with prejudice" or "<action> without prejudice".  Such
      a judgement is generally appropriate if and only if
      (1) the action is appropriate, and
      (2) the judgement is with prejudice if and only if the prior
          judge made an error in eir judgement which could have been
          reasonably avoided, or generally inappropriately discharged
          eir duties in the case.

      The valid values of <action> and their associated effects are as
      follows:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question; the prior judgement is assigned to the
        prior question again

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about whether
        the prior judgement was appropriate; the prior question is
        rendered open again; the judge SHOULD assign this judgement if
        the judge believes that the judge of the prior case will make
        a better judgement if given a new opportunity

      * REMIT, appropriate if there is serious doubt about whether the
        prior judgement was appropriate, or if the prior judge
        exhibited corruptive self-interest (material, with a specific
        and obvious impact on eir judgement and arguments, and not
        arising merely due to a difference of opinion or a wholly
        incidental material benefit common among many players); the
        judge of the prior case (if any) is recused, and the prior
        question is rendered open again; the judge SHOULD assign this
        judgement if the judge believes that the judge of the prior
        case will not make a better judgement if given a new
        opportunity

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question; the replacement judgement
        is assigned to the prior question

      The appropriateness of the prior judgement is measured at the
      time it was assigned.

      When an appeal case is initiated, the prior question is
      suspended, and remains so until the question on disposition in
      the appeal case is judged.

      As soon as possible after a judicial panel is assigned, each
      member of the panel SHALL publish an appeals opinion indicating
      a valid judgement to assign to the case -- only the last such
      published opinion for each member is used to determine the
      outcome.  Each member SHOULD choose an appropriate judgement,
      and include arguments for eir choice.  If prejudice is not
      explicitly specified, then an opinion indicating AFFIRM or
      REMAND implicitly indicates without prejudice, while an opinion
      indicating REMIT or OVERRULE implicitly indicates with
      prejudice.

      If, immediately after either all members have so published or
      the time limit for so publishing has ended, a majority of the
      members have opined for the same judgement, the panel acts to
      deliver the judgement in question.  If the panel publishes a
      valid judgement via another mechanism specified in the Rules,
      the requirement for individual members to publish individual
      opinions is waived.

      If the time period ends with no majority judgement, then the
      CotC CAN, and SHALL as soon as possible, by announcement cause
      the panel to judge either REMAND or REMIT with or without
      prejudice, whichever e feels is most appropriate.

      Any panel member CAN publish a formal Concurring Opinion with
      panel member support, provided that the panel has judged AFFIRM,
      and SHOULD do so if and only if the reasoning by which the prior
      judge reached eir judgement was incorrect in whole or part.  A
      Concurring Opinion SHOULD explain the nature of the error(s) in
      the prior judge's reasoning.  Each Concurring Opinion has an
      error rating, an integer from 1 to 99, with larger numbers
      corresponding to larger errors in reasoning; it CAN be specified
      in the announcement of intent, or else defaults to 50.

      In the week after the panel publishes a valid judgement, any
      panel member CAN publish a formal Dissenting Opinion with
      Support.  This Dissenting Opinion becomes a part of the record
      of the case; it can be used as an aid to help interpret the
      decision.

      The judge of a previously-appealed question SHALL NOT assign the
      same judgement to it without new reasoning that addresses the
      serious doubt about its appropriateness.  Violating this
      prohibition is the Class-N Crime of Lazy Judging, where N is the
      judge's rank when e so judged.

[CFJ 1597 (called 22 December 2006): It is possible to appeal a
judgement even if it is not certain that the judgement exists.]

[CFJ 1800 (called 18 November 2007): An announcement of the form "I
call for the appeal of <judgement>" has the effect of initiating the
Agoran decision on whether to approve appealing the cited judgement.]

Rule 2175/6 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case (other than an appeal case) that
      has not had any judge assigned to it.  The initiator of a new
      case CAN retract it by announcement, thus causing it to cease to
      be a judicial case.

      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same week as that case.
      A person SHALL NOT initiate an excess case.  The Clerk of the
      Courts CAN refuse an excess case by  announcement, thus causing
      it to cease to be a judicial case.  When e does so, e fulfills
      any obligations with regards to that case.

Rule 1868/17 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge.
      This is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.

      At any time, a judicial case either does not require a judge
      (default) or requires a judge.  This is not a persistent status,
      but is evaluated instantaneously.

      When a judicial case requires a judge and has no judge assigned,
      the CotC CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by
      announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as possible.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
      case are the active first-class players who have not previously
      been assigned as its judge, subject to modification by other
      rules.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge does not
      inherently prevent an entity from continuing to be judge of a
      case to which e is already assigned.  Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, second-class players are always unqualified to
      judge.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is
      still the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from
      that case by announcement.

      Making an entity unqualified or poorly qualified to judge is
      secured, with a power threshold of 1.5.

      To recuse a judge from a case is to deassign em as its judge.
      Assigning a judge to a case implicitly recuses its existing
      judge, if any.  A recusal "with cause" is a recusal defined as
      such by the rules.

      A player CAN favor or disfavor a judicial case by announcement.
      When assigning a judge to a judicial case, the CotC, if
      possible, SHALL assign a player who has favored it and SHALL NOT
      assign a player who has disfavored it.

[CFJ 1186: The Clerk of the Courts is required by Rule 1868 to select
a Judge who is qualified ["eligible" at the time of CFJ 1186] at the
time that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
qualified at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced.]

Rule 1871/28 (Power=1.5)
The Standing Court

      Posture is a player switch, tracked by the Clerk of the Courts,
      with the following values:

      * Standing.  Standing players are generally qualified to judge.

      * Sitting.  Sitting players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        will generally become qualified when the CotC rotates the
        bench.

      * Leaning.  Leaning players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        are generally qualified to serve on appeal panels.

      * Supine (default).  Supine players are unqualified to judge.

      Changes to posture are secured.

      A player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value by
      announcement.

      When the CotC assigns a player as judge, that player becomes
      sitting.

      The CotC CAN rotate the bench (change all sitting players to
      standing) by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so unless, of the
      judicial cases requiring assignment:

       a) no entity is well-qualified to be assigned to any of them;

       b) e immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns
          a judge to at least one of them.

      When the CotC recuses a non-supine player with cause, e CAN flip
      that player's posture to supine by announcement in a timely
      fashion.

[CFJ 1765 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, this rule makes em capable of doing
so.]

[CFJ 1766 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, eir capability to do so exists as
long as the obligation does, and this obligation does not terminate
due to the time limit running out.]

      required by the Rules, were e the judge, to publish in a
      judicial declaration.

      The author of a judicial declaration SHOULD attempt to ratify it

      SHOULD NOT object to such an attempt unless the judicial
      declaration was invalid or illegally published.

Patent Titles and Degrees
      A category concerning titles of honor and dishonor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/31 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item given in recognition of a
      person's distinction.  The Herald is an office; its holder is
      responsible for tracking Patent Titles.

      A person specifically authorized by the rules to award (revoke)
      a Patent Title SHALL do so as soon as possible after the
      conditions authorizing em to do so are announced, unless there
      is an open judicial question contesting the validity of those
      conditions.  Awarding or revoking a Patent Title by any other
      method is secured.

      While a Patent Title has been awarded to (and not revoked from)
      an entity, that entity is said to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.  The Herald's monthly report
      includes a list of each Patent Title that at least one entity
      Bears, with a list of which entities Bear it.

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

      When a patent title is used as a noun to refer to bearers of the
      patent title, it is assumed to refer only to persons who Bear
      that patent title unless context clearly indicates otherwise.

[CFJ 1525 (called 15 November 2004): If a patent title is defined by
the rules, and previously the rules defined a patent title with the
same spelling but a different award condition, the two are the same
patent title.]

[CFJ 1592 (called 1 December 2006): A patent title, once borne, is
borne until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent
title is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.]

[CFJ 1731 (called 23 August 2007): It is possible for an entity [a
person at the time of CFJ 1731] to bear more than one instance of a
patent title simultaneously.]

[CFJ 1591 (called 1 December 2006): Where a person bears the patent
title X, and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special
meaning, it is correct to say that that person "is an X".]

[Cross-references (9 February 2008): the Herald's duties are:
  * report Patent Titles (rule 649)
  * announce award or revocation of Patent Title (rule 649)
  * announce whether a notice of violation is valid (rule 2230)
  * assign ID numbers to valid notices of violation (rule 2230)
  * initiate decision for degree award (rule 1367)
  * award degrees (rule 1367)]

Rule 1367/15 (Power=3)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.

      After a player publishes a suitable thesis with explicit intent
      to qualify for a degree (the specific degree need not be
      mentioned), the Herald SHALL, as soon as possible, initiate an
      Agoran Decision to award that player (the author) a degree as
      follows:

       - The available options are FAILING GRADE and each degree that
         the author does not have. The available options can change
         during the voting period.

       - The eligible voters are each active player at the time the
         decision is initiated.

       - Each player's voting limit on the decision is one plus the
         number of degrees e holds.

       - The specific thesis for which the degree is to be awarded is
         an essential parameter of the decision (but not the text of
         that thesis).

       - The outcome is, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         highest-ranked degree such that more than half the votes cast
         were for that degree or a higher degree, or FAILING GRADE if
         there was no such degree.

      When the Herald resolves the decision, e CAN and SHALL award the
      author the degree selected by Agora, or no degree if FAILING
      GRADE was the outcome.

Rule 2231/3 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      The set of patent titles defined in this rule constitute the
      Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic; the titles may be collectively
      referred to as "Heroic titles" and a Bearer of a Heroic title as
      a Hero.

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier titles of distinction, and CAN
      be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a proposal
      of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those persons
      are qualified.  Players SHOULD NOT cause heroic titles to be
      revoked.  Heroes are entitled to use the abbreviation of eir
      title as post-nomial letters in Agora communications and
      reports.

      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:

      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title may be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence
      of Agora and/or Nomic in general.  As this title is the highest
      honour that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be
      treated right good forever.

      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.

Rule 1727/17 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

      BE IT FURTHERMORE RESOLVED that Agora's Unbirthday is defined to
      be the entire day of December 30, GMT +1200, of each year; but,
      since that falls within a Holiday, is observed during the entire
      days of January 12 through 14, GMT +1200, of each year.

[CFJ 1881 (called 25 January 2008): This rule does not impose an
obilgation to always Dance a Powerful Dance, because "Marvy" is
currently undefined.]

[CFJ 1736 (called 23 August 2007): Failing to hail Eris does not
necessarily constitute a violation of this rule.]

Contracts / Binding Agreements

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement that is not binding
is thereby not a contract.]

[CFJ 1901 (called 4 February 2008): An agreement that is binding is
thereby a contract, even if it doesn't impose any obligations.]

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement's text can disclaim
contract/binding status, thereby nullifying itself, by explicitly
describing itself as a non-contract or as non-binding.]

[CFJ 1872 (called 15 January 2008): Being a player is not a
prerequisite for becoming party to a contract.]

[CFJ 1796 (called 14 November 2007): If a person announces that e
agrees to be bound by a particular text as a contract, without saying
who this agreement is with, and the contract text does not regulate
who can become a party to it, then any person can become a party to
the contract by announcement.]

[CFJ 1455 (called 14 March 2003): A contract cannot cause an
otherwise-insignificant action by a non-party to constitute consent to
be bound by the contract.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): A contract is null and void if
the courts do not have sufficient evidence that a person's
contract-related rights (in rule 101) are not being infringed.  This
includes evidence that the party to the contract has reviewed the
rules and has direct prior knowledge of the fora.]

[CFJ 1686 (called 7 June 2007): A person who is not a party to an
agreement categorically cannot violate it.]

[CFJ 1752 (called 28 September 2007): Deregistration does not
implicitly cause the ex-player to leave a contract.]

[CFJ 1842 (called 20 December 2007): A contract may use retroactive
operations internally for the purposes of determining obligations of
the parties, but such legal fictions do not affect Agora as a whole.]

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): A contract cannot have
retroactive effect.]

[CFJ 1843 (called 20 December 2007): Becoming a party to a contract
cannot occur retroactively, for the purposes of determining
justiciability of the contract.]

[CFJ 1816 (called 2 December 2007): A contract is not generally able
to define terms used by the rules.]

[CFJ 1819 (called 3 December 2007): A contract is not able to create
new ways of winning the game.]

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): An authorisation granted by a
party in a contract takes precedence over a unilateral statement by
that party that purports to cancel that authorisation.]

[CFJ 1921 (called 2 April 2008): Agreements with informal phrasing can
be considered contracts, but only when made in a medium where lying is
against the Rules (i.e. a public forum).]

[CFJ 2302 (called 7 December 2008): The scope of the text of a
contract is limited compared to that of a rule; in particular, a
contract cannot cause a paradox by setting undecidable conditions on
joining it.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Truthfulness

[CFJ 1739 (called 29 August 2007): A quotation can result in a
violation of rule 2215 (then 2149), depending on the context of the
rest of the message.]

[CFJ 1849 (called 21 December 2007): Violation of rule 2215 (then
2149) can occur without any intent to misdirect.]

[CFJ 1887 (called 30 January 2008): Publicly making the statement
"This statement is a lie." would most likely be a violation of rule
2215 (then 2149), because it is logically indeterminate and so making
it would not be telling the truth, and its logical indeterminacy would
be understood by any reasonable player.]

[CFJ 2103 (called 21 July 2008): Making the statement "I lie." is not
a violation of Rule 2215 if the author is lying down.]

[CFJ 2399 (called 4 March 2009): Even if a type of behavior is likely
to cause false statements to be accidentally published, a person does
not violate rule 2215 by engaging in it if there is no specific
statement e believes is false.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Miscellaneous

[CFJ 2276a (called 20 November 2008): When a rule allows, as an
action, a quantity to be increased which is defined elsewhere as a
fixed value, and that action is taken, the rule thereby redefines the
quantity as one more than it would otherwise be.]
