Rule 101/4 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absense of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to invoke judgement, appeal a
            judgement, and to initiate an appeal on a sentencing or
            judicial order binding em.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absense of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player besides the Speaker has the right to
            deregister rather than continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.
 CFJ 1132, Judged May 18, 1999: A Player failing to perform a duty
 required by the Rules within a reasonable time may be in violation
 of the Rules, even if the Rules do not provide a time limit for
 the performance of that duty.]

Rule 2125/0 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if:

      (a) the action is prohibited;

      (b) the rules indicate that if certain conditions are satisfied,
          then some player is permitted to perform the action;

      (c) the action would, as part of its effect, modify information
          for which some player is required to be a recordkeepor;

      (d) the action would, as part of its effect, make it impossible
          to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
          combinations of actions by players; or

      (e) the courts have held that the action is regulated, and this
          finding has not been overturned.

Rule 1688/2 (Power=3)
Power

      The power of an entity is a natural number, which is zero unless
      otherwise defined or modified according to procedures defined by
      the rules.  An instrument is an entity with positive power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power (low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858)
 Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule of higher Power to
 mean something other than its ordinary English meaning, that
 may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does must be
 decided on a case-by-case basis.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

[CFJs 1114 and 1115 (both Judged Feb. 5 1999): This Rule is to be
 applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just
 because a Rule is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict
 with a Rule of higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is
 nullified in all cases.]

Rule 2110/0 (Power=3)
Win by Paradox

      If the legality of an action cannot be determined with finality,
      or if by a Judge's best reasoning, not appealed within a week of
      eir Judgement, an action appears equally legal and illegal, then
      the Speaker shall award the Patent Title of Champion to the
      first Player to publicly note that condition.  The Herald shall
      record that this Title was achieved "by paradox" in eir report.

Rule 1727/14 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICAL NAME of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year, and as soon
      as possible after the end of Agora's Birthday, the Herald shall
      award the boon of celebration to each Player who, during Agora's
      Birthday, publicly recognizes this Grand Event.

Definition and Continuity of Entities

      No two Rule-defined entities shall have the same name or
      nickname.

      If the Rules defining some entity are repealed or amended
      such that they no longer define that entity, then that
      entity along with all its properties shall cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they
      still define that entity but with different properties,
      that entity and its properties shall continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

Rule 869/17 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering is permitted to register.

      A person registers or deregisters by announcement.

      Whenever a person registers, e becomes a player.

      Whenever a player deregisters or is deregistered, e ceases to be
      a player and is prohibited from registering for the next thirty
      days.

[CFJ 805: "Person" here means a natural person, not a legal person
 (such as a corporation) or something named "person."
 CFJ 1263: Any message expressing a clear desire or intent to register
 as a Player counts as a request for registration, whether or not it
 is explicitly phrased as a request.]

Rule 1789/3 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

Rule 478/16 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that No Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

      A Forum's Publicity may be either null, Discussion, or Public
      (default null).  A forum's publicity may not be changed except
      as described in this rule.

      The Herald may change the publicity of a forum without objection
      as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Herald makes that forum public is sent to all existing
          public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      The Herald's report shall include a list of all public or
      discussion fora and sufficient data regarding each to allow
      players to receive messages via that medium.  The Herald need
      not keep track of null fora.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A player "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  A player performs an action "by private message"
      to some player by sending an appropriate private message to the
      specified player.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

[CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
 all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.
 CFJ 813: A Player need not prove that e can receive the PF.
 CFJ 831: The Date: header of a message is not necessarily the time
 at which the message takes effect.
 CFJ 1112, Judged TRUE Jan. 21 1999: "In order to submit a Proposal,
 in the sense of R1865 and elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a
 collection of text 'with the clear indication that that text is
 intended to become a Proposal' (R1483) merely be sent to the Public
 Forum by a Proposing Entity; the collection of text must also be
 received in the Public Forum."]

Rule 754/6 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules shall be interpreted
          as having that meaning, as shall its ordinary-language
          synonyms not explicitly defined by the rules.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, shall
          be interpreted as having the meaning it has in those
          contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          shall be interpreted as having its ordinary-language
          meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

Rule 1023/17 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      - Agoran days begin at midnight GMT.  Agoran weeks begin at
        midnight GMT on Monday.  Agoran months begin at midnight GMT
        on the first day of each Gregorian month.  Agoran quarters
        begin when the Agoran months of January, April, July, and
        October begin.  Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of

      - A requirement to perform an action "as soon as possible" is a
        requirement to perform the action within seven days.

      - The term "number" shall be interpreted as "real number".

      - The term "random" shall mean a choice drawn with a process
        whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
        reasonably close to that required by the Rules, using a
        uniform distribution if not otherwise specified.

[CFJ 1075: Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with
 lower precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
 purely discussionary nature.]

Rule 1728/11 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer.  The phrase
      "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection",
      and the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N players have publicly posted objections
                to the performance of the action; or

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N players other than the player who made the
                announcement under (a) of this rule have publicly
                posted support for the performance of the action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections
           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit
           the action to be performed Without N Objections or do not
           permit the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

      (g)  e announces that e performs the described action.

      A dependent action is not performed until announced as in (g).

      A player who posts an objection to the performance of an action
      may publicly retract eir objection.  If e does so, e shall be
      deemed not have posted an objection to the performance of that
      action for the purposes of (e)(1) of this rule.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      A rule authorising the performance of a dependent action may
      restrict the eligibility of players to support or object to that
      specific action.

      Agoran Consent, then the entity may perform the action by
      announcement if all of the following are true:

      (a) e has published eir intent to perform the action,
          unambiguously describing the action to be performed, at
          least four days and no more than fourteen days before
          attempting to perform the action;

          support for the intended action since intent was published;
          and

Rule 1769/3 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

Rule 402/16 (Power=1)
Church and State

      A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the current
      Speaker.

      For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
      players simultaneously winning, then any player may announce
      that the winning cardinal becomes a pope.  Upon this
      announcement, that player becomes a pope, so please treat em
      right good forever.  Also upon this announcement, the current
      Speaker ceases to be Speaker, and the new pope is installed as
      the new Speaker.

      If the legality of an installation is not challenged within
      seven days of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to
      stand, even if is subsequently found to be illegal.

      Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, if a Player becomes
      Speaker via this method, e may not be removed from the
      Speakership for 90 days without eir own consent.

Rule 1006/10 (Power=1)
Offices

      The Rules may designate positions to be offices.  No office may
      be held by more than one player.  Each office that would
      otherwise not be held by any player shall be held by the
      Speaker, unless it is not possible for the Speaker to hold that
      office.

      The holder of an office may be referred to by the name of the
      office.  The Herald shall list the holder of each office, and
      the date upon which each holder last came to hold that office.

      Any Player may make an active Player the holder of an office,
      thus removing any previous holder from the office, with Agoran
      Consent, provided:
      (a) that office has not changed hands with this method in the
          previous 30 days, and
      (b) the potential officer consents to hold the office after the
          announcement of intent is made.

      If no attempt to acheive Agoran Consent for changing the holder
      of particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
      Speaker shall make at least one such attempt to change the
      officeholder in the following quarter, and make the change if
      consent is acheived.

      If the duty of an office is to maintain certain information,
      than the officer shall publish that information once a month, or
      as soon as possible after a substantial change occurs in the
      information or the officer receives a request for the
      information.  A weekly report shall be sufficient to satisfy
      these last two requirements.

      If an Officer or the Speaker fails to satisfy a Timing Order to
      perform a certain offical duty, than the player who executed the
      order may perform the duty as if e were the officer.

      ratify, without objection, any official report.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

      A document's maintainer shall annotate all publications of that
      document with the date of its most recent ratification.

Rule 1681/8 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's
      number, revision number, power, title, and text, and must also
      include any annotations to the rule required by order.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeeper shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
      of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
      mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
      changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
      proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.

Rule 1607/12 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor is permitted to distribute a proposal in the
      Proposal Pool at any time.  During each week, the Promotor must
      distribute each proposal in the proposal pool which was in the
      Proposal Pool at the beginning of the week.

      The Promotor legally distributes a proposal by publishing it
      accompanied by an explicit indication that it is being
      distributed.  When a proposal is distributed, it is removed from
      the Proposal Pool.  The distribution of a proposal initiates the
      Agoran decision of whether to adopt the proposal, as described
      elsewhere.

      The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
      proposal the identity of its proposer, the proposal's coauthors,
      if any, its chamber, and its adoption index.  However, the
      failure of the Promotor to include any of these with a proposal
      does not deprive the distribution of the proposal of any legal
      effect.

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decisionmaking process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:

Rule 107/3 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  To be valid, this notice must contain
      the following information:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) The identity of the vote collector.

      (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
          announcement.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days.

Rule 683/12 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted by an eligible voter during the
          voting period for the decision.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

Rule 2127/0 (Power=1)
Conditional Votes

      A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be submitted
      conditionally, and the truth or falsity of the condition and
      thus the selected option will be determined as it exists at the
      end of the voting period.

      The option selected shall be considered to be clearly identified
      if and only if the truth or falsity of the specified
      condition(s) can be reasonably determined, without circularity
      or paradox, from information published within the voting period.

Rule 2117/0 (Power=3)
Replacing the Vote Collector

      If the rules indicate that an office is to be responsible for
      collecting votes on a particular Agoran decision, then the
      holder of that office is the default vote collector for that
      decision.

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is tardy if
      and only if the voting collector has continuously held that role
      for at least seven days following the end of the voting period
      and the decision has not yet been resolved.  If a vote collector
      is tardy, then the first player to announce that e takes up the
      role of vote collector becomes the vote collector for that
      decision.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow the
      vote collector for an Agoran decision to be changed.

Voting Limits

      The voting limit of an eligible voter on a democratic proposal
      is always one and cannot be changed.

      The voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary proposal is
      one, if not explicitly modified by other rules.

      After the voting period for an Agoran decision has ended, the
      vote collector shall permit the first valid ballots submitted by
      an eligible voter to remain valid, up to a number equal to that
      person's voting limit on that decision as determined when the
      voting period for that decision began, and shall invalidate all
      subsequent ballots submitted by that voter on that decision.

Rule 208/3 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is
      authorized to resolve that decision, and does so by publishing a
      valid notice which states that the matter has been resolved,
      indicating the option selected by Agora.  To be valid, this
      notice must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It clearly identifies the options available.

      (d) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision shall have at most one vote collector at a
      time.  The identity of the vote collector is set by the message
      initiating the decision, and can only be changed as specified by
      other rules with power at least as great as that of this rule.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

Rule 955/10 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      To determine which option on a particular Agoran decision was
      selected by Agora, the vote collector shall perform the
      following steps in order after the voting period has ended.

      (a) E shall invalidate any ballots which the rules require em to
          invalidate, and no others.

      (b) E shall count the number of distinct voters who submitted
          ballots which remain valid.  If this number is less than the
          quorum and there is more than one available option, then the
          option selected by Agora is FAILED QUORUM.  Otherwise, the
          decision achieved quorum.

      (c) If the decision is whether to adopt a proposal, e shall
          determine the voting index as follows:

          (1) if the strength of FOR is positive and the strength of
              AGAINST is zero, then the voting index is Unanimity; but

          (2) if the strength of FOR is zero, then the voting index is
              zero; otherwise,

          (3) the voting index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to
              the strength of AGAINST.

          If the voting index exceeds one and meets or exceeds the
          adoption index of the decision, and if further quorum was
          achieved, then the option selected by Agora is ADOPTED.
          Otherwise, the option selected by Agora is REJECTED.

Rule 2034/2 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change
      the validity of one or more of a voter's ballots on an Agoran
      decision whose voting period has begun but which has not yet
      been resolved shall be wholly without effect, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, no ballots on that
      decision may be validly submitted or retracted, and the outcome
      of the decision may not be changed in any way, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  Nothing in this rule shall be
      construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting
      the resolution of an Agoran decision.

      If the success of the resolution of an Agoran decision is not
      challenged within one week from the time the vote collector
      announces it, then the announced result is the true result of
      that decision, even if it would otherwise be in error.

Rule 2126/0 (Power=3)
Voting Credits

      Voting Credits (VCs) are a measure of each player's ability to
      affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  A player's VC is at
      all times a non-negative integer.  The Promotor is the
      recordkeepor of VCs.  VCs are not any form of property and
      cannot be traded.  VCs can be affected only as described in this
      rule.

      When one or more players win the game, all players' voting
      limits on ordinary proposals are reset to one, subject to
      modification by other rules.

      When a player joins Agora, eir VCs are set to zero.

      When a proposal is adopted, its proposer gains VCs equal to the
      integer portion of the proposal's adoption index, and each
      co-author of the proposal gains one VC.

      A player may expend two VCs to increase eir own voting limit on
      ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend one VC to increase any other player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend two VCs to decrease any other player's
      voting limit on ordinary proposals by one, down to a minimum
      voting limit of zero.  Attempts to decrease a player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals below this minimum fail.

      If a player attempts to expend more VCs than e currently has,
      the action fails, and the VCs are not expended.

      The Promotor may accept reasonable synonyms for "expend" (such
      as "pay" or "use") as valid actions under this rule.

Rule 106/2 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The proposer of a
      proposal may remove it from the Pool by announcement.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
      PRESENT, and by default, the eligible voters are the active
      players, the adoption index is the adoption index of the
      proposal, and the vote collector is the Speaker.

      The default adoption index of a proposal is one.  Before the
      Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may modify its
      adoption index by announcement.  A Proposal with an Adoption
      Index of 1 is Ordinary.  All other Proposals are Democratic.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
      which would permit a proposal to take effect.

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 105/2 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      A proposal generally can, as part of its effect:

      (a) Enact a rule.  When a rule is enacted, the Rulekeepor shall
      assign it a number, which must be greater than any number
      previously assigned.  If the enacting proposal does not specify
      the power, the rule shall have power equal to one.  If the
      proposal specifies the power, then the rule shall have power
      equal to the minimum of four, the power of the proposal, and the
      power specified by the proposal.  If the title is not specified,
      the Rulekeepor may select any title e sees fit.

      (b) Modify the power, title, or text of a rule.  A Proposal can
      modify the power, title, or text of a rule with power no greater
      than its own.  However, a proposal cannot cause a rule to have
      power greater than its own.  Any ambiguity in a modification
      specified by a proposal causes that modification to be void and
      without effect.  A variation in whitespace or capitalization in
      the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

      (c) Repeal a rule.  When a proposal repeals a rule, it ceases to
      be a rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
      of it.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      enacted, modified, or repealed.

Legislative Orders

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended

        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

      plus one, other rules governing quorum notwithstanding.

      As soon as possible after a vetoed proposal fails quorum, the
      Assessor shall place a copy of that proposal to the Proposal
      Pool.  When e does so, that copy shall become distributable and
      democratic, and its adoption index shall be increased by one.

      The Speaker may Rubberstamp an Ordinary Proposal in its voting
      period by announcement.  Quorum for a rubberstamped ordinary
      proposal is three, other rules governing quorum nonwithstanding.

Orders
  This Category includes Rules concerning Orders generally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1793/2 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an official position
      in eir capacity in that official position, and if the position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      position.

      An Order may also be directed at a prior order so as to affect
      the prior order's operation, as the Rules permit.

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class are presumed valid and enforceable until proven
      otherwise by CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1794/8 (Power=1)
Classes of Orders

      Each Order is of exactly one of the following classes.  If an
      Order could be of more than one of these classes, then it is of
      the first class that matches.

        (a) A Legislative Order is an Order executed as part of the
            effect of the adoption of a Proposal.

        (b) An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of
            Appeals.

        (c) A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Judge in the
            course of performing eir duties or privileges as Judge.

        (d) A Timing Order is an Order which may be executed by any
            person and directed at any entity.  A timing order is
            valid if and only if it orders the entity to perform, as
            soon as possible, a duty specifically required of em by
            the Rules that does not otherwise have a specified timing
            requirement, or for which the otherwise specified timing
            requirement will have been exceeded as soon as possible
            after the Order is executed.

      No other types of Orders are valid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1795/5 (Power=1)
Order Timing

      An Order may specify the time limit for the performance of an
      ordered action.  If a time limit is less than 72 hours after the
      Order takes effect, the time limit shall be 72 hours.  If no
      time limit is specified, time limit shall be as soon as possible
      after the Order takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, then the
      current holder shall have as soon as possible to satisfy that
      order.

      The noncompliance of an order with this Rule does not deprive
      that order of all effect, but instead modifies the timing
      requirements of the order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1799/3 (Power=1)
Stay and Vacation of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily prevent the
      stayed Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be specified to expire after a fixed time.  If no
      specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall not
      expire.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

      Any Order may always be stayed or vacated by the Player (or, in
      the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.
      Certain classes of Orders may be stayed or vacated in other
      circumstances as well, but only as the Rules allow.

Rule 1810/5 (Power=1)
Satisfying Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.  Except when otherwise
      specified, a single action can result in the satisfaction of at
      most one Order.  If an action would satisfy more than one Order,
      and no other specification is made, the Action satisfies the
      oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      Willfully performing contrary to valid orders, either through
      action or inaction, is a violation of this Rule.

Invoking Judgement

      Any person may request formal resolution of a dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The submission of a CFJ constitutes proof
      of the existence of such a dispute.

      A CFJ should be a single clearly-labeled Statement whose truth
      or falsity can be determined using logical reasoning, assuming
      perfect knowledge.  A CFJ may be accompanied by Arguments,
      Evidence, or other related material; the Judge is encouraged,
      but not required, to take notice of these things.

Rule 897/4 (Power=1)
Court Procedure

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish the text of a CFJ, along
      with any additional material submitted by the Caller and the
      Defendant if any (including but not limited to Arguments and
      Evidence), no later than the time e announces the identity of
      the first Judge assigned to that CFJ.

      When a Civil CFJ is submitted, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      publish the text of the CFJ and send a copy of the CFJ to the
      Defendant's registered e-mail address, if any, and inform the
      Defendant that e has one week to publish a defense and/or bar a
      Player from judging as described below.

      The CotC will not assign a Civil CFJ to a judge until one week
      has passed since after a publication.  During this time, any
      evidence or arguments, published or submitted to the CotC by the
      Defendant with the clear intent of being part of a defense, will
      become part of the material of that CFJ.

      A Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that
      CFJ.

      When submitting a general CFJ, the Caller may Bar up to three
      Players from Judging that CFJ.

      The defendant of a Civil CFJ is automatically barred from
      judging it. The Plantiff may bar one other Player when e submits
      the CFJ.  The Defendant may bar one other Player from judging
      any time before the CFJ is assigned to a judge.

Rule 2024/3 (Power=1)
Linked Statements

      Linked CFJs are multiple Calls for Judgement that are submitted
      in a single message and clearly labelled as Linked CFJs.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall assign a Judge to a set of Linked
      CFJs, as if they were a single CFJ.  The Judge must be eligible
      to Judge each of the Linked CFJs, and is simultaneously assigned
      as Judge of each of the Linked CFJs.

      A Judge (the first judge) may transfer a CFJ to a second judge
      by announcement, thus linking the first and second CFJs and
      unlinking the first CFJ with any it was previously linked to,
      with the second judge's consent and provided the second judge
      has not been barred or recused from the first CFJ.

      The Judge of a set of Linked CFJs shall submit eir Judgement of
      each of those CFJs in a single message.

      If one or more Linked CFJs beyond the first are unrelated in
      subject matter to the first, then a Trial Judge may remand those
      CFJs to the Clerk of the Courts; e ceases to be Judge of those
      CFJs.

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
      be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
      two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, or if a Trial Judge
      is simultaneously and automatically recused from two or more
      Linked CFJs, then those CFJs continue to be Linked to each
      other, but not to any other CFJs to which the Judge is still
      assigned.

      A CFJ made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during the same Agoran Week is an Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the
      Courts may dismiss any Excess CFJ.

Selecting a Judge

Rule 1868/4 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      A CFJ is open if it has not been Judged, or if an outstanding
      judicial motion pertaining to it has been neither granted nor
      denied.  A CFJ is closed if it is not open.

      As soon as possible after becoming aware that an open CFJ has no
      Judge assigned to it, the Clerk of the Courts shall choose a
      Player eligible to Judge it, and announce them as its Trial
      Judge.  That Player remains the Trial Judge of that CFJ until e
      is recused from it or becomes ineligible to Judge it.

      Other rules may explicitly delay the timing requirement of
      making assignments, for example with respect to providing the
      Defendant with response time in a Civil CFJ.

CFJ 1186 (Judged TRUE, Dec. 9 1999): "The Clerk of the Courts is
 required by Rule 1868 to select a Judge who is eligible at the time
 that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
 eligible at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
 identity of that Player is announced."

[CFJ 1187, Judged TRUE Dec. 8 1999: "A Judge is considered to be

Always an Eligible Judge

      (a) Each active player is eligible to judge a given Call for

          ineligible.

      (b) If the Clerk of the Courts is required to select a Judge,
          but after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
          account, no player is eligible to judge that CFJ, then:

          (1) all non-barred players become eligible to judge that
              CFJ; then

          (2) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then all
              barred players, other than the caller emself, become
              eligible to judge that increasingly annoying CFJ; then

          (3) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then
              don't panic.  Somebody's bound to register someday; let
              em deal with it.

      (c) This rule takes precedence over other rules concerning who
          is and is not eligible to judge CFJs.

      Whenever an open CFJ has no Trial Judge assigned to it, and
      there are no players eligible to be assigned, the Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish a Notice of Rotation, specifying at least
      one such CFJ.  Upon such an announcement, all turned players
      become unturned.

      The CotC may turn a player e expects to judge CFJs slowly or not
      at all, without 2 objections.

      If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by selecting a
      Player to Judge a CFJ or Appeal who is not eligible to judge
      that CFJ or Appeal solely because e is turned, then that
      selection shall stand, unless the Clerk of the Courts points out
      eir error and makes a new selection before the selected Player
      returns Judgement.

Rule 217/5 (Power=3)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom, common
      sense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game
      before applying other standards.

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

[CFJ 684: An Injunction on the interpretation of a Rule is part of
 Game Custom.
 CFJ 897: The requirements in Rule 217 on Judgements apply to the
 determinations of the members of a Board of Appeal, as well as to
 the Judgements of Judges.
 CFJ 1139, Judged Jun. 20 1999: Judgements need not necessarily accord
 with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or Justices given in
 past CFJs.
 CFJ 1219, Judged May 23, 2000, Appeal decision published, Jun. 13
 2000: A mistaken Judgement (ie one that does not accord with the
 Rules) is still a Judgement, as long as the technical requirements on
 the delivery of the Judgement have been met.]

Rule 1575/6 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      Unless otherwise specified, all Judgements shall be consistent
      with the preponderance of the evidence.

      A defendant may not be assessed punitive damages for Rules
      Violations any worse than a formal apology, unless a Judge finds
      that evidence for the violation is beyond a reasonable doubt.

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

           Statement.

       ii) After a reasonable effort to obtain all relevant
           information, the Judge can neither determine the Statement
           to be true nor determine it to be false.

      iii) The Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.

       iv) The CFJ lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.

Judicial and Sentencing Orders

      Judicial Orders and Sentencing Orders are executed by being sent
      to the Clerk of the Courts, but do not take effect until their
      publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts
      shall publish each Judicial Order and Sentencing Order as soon
      as possible after receiving it from the Judge who executed it.

      Any Player may formally request a Judge issue any Judicial Order
      by filing a motion requesting that Order.  If granted, the Judge
      shall issue the Order requested.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1826/1 (Power=1)
Motions

      A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
      CFJ.  A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the
      Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
      possible after receiving it.  A Judge must either grant or deny
      each Motion so forwarded within five days of receiving it.  A
      Judge grants or denies a Motion by sending eir determination on
      that Motion to the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons e
      chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on its nature, but
      generally amounts to requiring the Judge to perform as requested
      by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
      when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one
      as usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
      Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

Rule 1509/4 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

No Compulsion of Judges

      Any Order to Compel directed to a Judge, or requiring the

      is a Judge, is invalid, unless that Order is a valid Appellate
      Order.

      Any CFJ alleging that a Judgement is incorrect, or that a Judge
      has failed to perform a judicial duty, lacks standing.  Such a
      claim should instead be pursued via Appeal.

Rule 789/6 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate Rules

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order; or if the
      original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or vacated.  The
      Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate a Rule Without
      Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way
      except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

[CFJ 684: Such an Order applies not only during Judging, but
 also in the everyday interpretation of the Rule.]

Rule 911/14 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected to reach a decision about the subject of the Appeal.  A
      Board of Appeals consists of three Appellate Judges.  Any Judge
      assigned according to this Rule is an Appellate Judge.

      A Board of Appeals is selected when the Clerk of the Courts
      correctly announces the identity of all Appellate Judges,
      determined as follows:

        a) The Speaker is selected, if eligible.
        b) The Clerk of the Courts is selected, if eligible.
        c) Any remaining positions are filled by selection by the
           Clerk of the Courts from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected for that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed from that Board.
      iii) E has been Trial Judge of the subject of the Appeal.
       iv) E is ineligible to Judge the CFJ at the time of selection.

      An Appellate Judge may appoint another eligible Player as eir
      replacement by informing the Clerk of the Courts, provided the
      Player consents.

      As soon as possible after an Appellate Judge is recused, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select an eligible Player to
      replace em.

      The last Appellate Judge selected is the Lead Judge for that
      Board.  If the Lead Judge is replaced, then the replacement
      becomes Lead Judge.

Rule 1447/19 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      For an Appelate Judge assigned to the Appeal of a Judgement, a
      Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN, REVERSE,
      REASSIGN, or REMAND.  For the appeal of other matters, a
      Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN or OVERTURN.
      Other Rules may modify this based on the subject of the Appeal.

      If a Judgement of TRUE or FALSE is Appealed, the Board of
      Appeals shall consider the correctness of that Judgement.  If a
      Judgement of DISMISSED is Appealed, the Board shall not consider
      the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they shall only
      consider whether a Judgement of DISMISSED should have been
      delivered.

      If a majority of the Appellate Judges Judge SUSTAIN, then the
      subject of the Appeal is sustained.  Otherwise, it is
      overturned.  The Board of Appeals shall execute whatever
      Appelate Orders are necessary to enforce its determination.

      When a Judgement is overturned:

        a) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REVERSE, then
           the CFJ shall be treated as if it were Judged normally,
           with the Judgement being that which a majority of the
           Appelate Judges agree on.

        b) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REASSIGN, then
           the original Judgement is ignored, the original Judge is
           recused, and the Clerk of the Courts shall reassign the CFJ
           to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was originally
           assigned.  The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement as
           the original Judge for the same reason.

        c) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REMAND, then the
           original Judgement shall be ignored, and the Clerk of the
           Courts shall reassign the CFJ to the original Judge as if
           it were being originally assigned. The Judge may not make
           the same Judgement for the same reason.

        d) If none of the above is true, then the CFJ shall be
           reassigned as described above.

      As soon as possible after all members of a Board of Appeals have
      submitted eir Judgement, the Clerk of the Courts shall announce
      that this has happened.

Rule 1804/3 (Power=1)
Appeal of Judicial and Sentencing Orders

      As soon as possible after a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order
      is Appealed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay it.  If the
      Appeal is sustained, then the Board of Appeals shall vacate this
      stay as soon as possible.  If the Appeal is overturned, then the
      Board of Appeals shall vacate the stayed Order as soon as
      possible.

      In the Appeal of a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order, the Board
      of Appeals shall consider whether the Order was properly and
      validly executed.

Rule 1805/2 (Power=1)
Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Judge of a Board of Appeals, but do not take
      effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The
      Lead Judge must certify in the execution that the order is
      executed by the concurrence of the majority of the Justices
      comprising that Board of Appeals; failure to do so deprives the
      Order of effect.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Order which
      was accompanied by that false certification.

      Appellate Orders are valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.
      All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.

Rule 1504/8 (Power=1)
Sentencing Orders

      Upon a finding in a Civil CFJ that the defendant has broken one
      or more Rules, the Trial Judge must execute exactly one of the
      following types of sentencing orders as punitive damages:

      (1) Without Objection and with 1 Support, an order the defendant
          to make a formal apology;

      (2) Without 2 Objections and with 2 Supporters, an order for the
          defendant to perform a specified service for the benefit of
          the Agoran community proportinate to the seriousness of the
          breach;

      (3) An order for the Herald to place the defendant in the Chokey
          for a number of months equal to the power of the highest
          powered Rule that was broken;

      (4) If and only if the trial judge finds the defendant to to
          have acted willfully in breaking the rules, an order for the
          Herald to place the defendant in the Chokey for twice number
          of months equal to the power of the highest-powered Rule
          that was broken;

      (5) If and only if the judge finds the defendant to have acted
          egregiously, maliciously, or with a consistent pattern of
          abuse, with Agoran Consent, an order for the Registrar to
          deregister the defendant in disgrace (make em lawless).  An
          order to be made lawless is automatically appealed upon its
          initial execution.

      These punishments are considered ranked with "worse" punishments
      being later in the list.

      If an attempted sentencing order does not receive the proper
      support or receives too many objections, the trial judge must
      execute another type of sentencing order.

      No other punitive damages may be assessed for Rules violations.

Rule 649/18 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person is said
      to Bear that Patent Title.  When a Patent Title is revoked from
      a person, that person ceases to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.

      As soon as possible after the Rules state that a Patent title
      shall be awarded or revoked, the Herald shall publicly award or
      revoke that Patent Title.

Rule 1922/10 (Power=1)
Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for the Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as one, with two Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with three Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
           Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
           awarded to any player who has held a particular Office
           continuously for the specified duration.  Each of these
           titles shall be awarded only once per player.

Rule 1370/15 (Power=1)
How to Get a Degree

      A person becomes a Candidate for a Degree when e publishes a
      Thesis along with a statement explicitly indicating that the
      Thesis is being submitted with the intent to qualify for a
      particular degree.  A Thesis (plural: Theses) is an essay whose
      topic is any facet of Agora Nomic, or Nomic in general.

      The Candidate shall choose a Player other tham emself to be the
      first member of eir Thesis Committee, called eir Chair, with the
      Chair's consent.

      If the Speaker is neither the Chair nor the Candidate, the
      Speaker shall appoint a Player who is neither the Chair nor the
      Candidate to be the second Committee member.  Otherwise, the the
      Clerk of the Courts shall so appoint.  The two Committee members
      shall then select, by mutual consent, a third person who is not
      the Candidate to be the third Committee member.

      The Committee shall examine the Candidate and eir Thesis to
      determine eir qualifications for the Degree.  The Chair of the
      Thesis Committee may award that Degree to the Candidate if and
      only if:

      * the Candidate has satisfied all prerequisites in the Rules for
        the award of that Degree;
      * a majority of members of the Thesis Committee agree that the
        Thesis is worthy of the Degree to be granted.  Attention
        should be paid to the originality and strength of the work, as
        well as the extent of the work with regard to the expectations
        of the particular degree.  The committee may award a lesser
        degree if appropriate; and
      * fewer than seven years have passed since that Committee was
        formed.

      Each Committee Member may publish a Commentary for the Thesis.
      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis that has
      resulted in a degree, along with all such Commentaries.

Honorary Degrees

      A degree may be awarded by the operation of an adopted Proposal
      whose Power is at least two to any person who is not registered
      as a Player and who does not already bear that degree.  The
      Proposal must specify both the recipient of the degree and the

      manner, the recipient need not complete a Thesis, but all other
      requirements specific to the degree in question must be
      satisfied.

      Degrees awarded as described in this rule shall be marked as
      honorary degrees in the Herald's report.  A person bearing an

Contract Law

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/4 (Power=1)
Agreements between Players

      Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
      that such agreements will be binding; i.e. that they become
      parties to the agreement and agree to be bound by the agreement.

      A CFJ that alleges that a specific person (the Defendant) has
      broken an agreement is a Civil CFJ, for which the Caller is the
      Plaintiff.  A CFJ that is not a Civil CFJ is a General CFJ.

      If the judge of a Civil CFJ finds that the agreement was entered
      into with the intention that the agreement be binding, and that
      the agreement has in fact been broken, then e may do any or all
      of the following:

         (i) order the defendant to perform according to the agreement
             or perform substitute acts that would fairly serve the
             interests of the agreement;

        (ii) order the other parties of the agreement to perform such
             acts as may be necessary to preserve fairness and
             justice;

       (iii) order that additional ("punitive") penalties or actions
             be applied to the defendant, if and only if the agreement
             in question explicitly specifies punitive penalties for
             the type of breach.

      If a Civil CFJ is called by anyone who is not party to that
      agreement, then it lacks standing and shall be dismissed.  A
      Civil CFJ that specifies multiple defendants, or multiple
      independent breaches of contract, is improperly made and shall
      be dismissed.

      Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

Rule 1503/6 (Power=3)
Rules Violations

      In general, the Rules shall be adjudicated as if the Rules were
      a binding agreement between all Players, entered into by every
      player as a part of becoming a Player.  An actual or alleged
      Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding
      agreement to be bound by the Rule or Rules in question.

      The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
      be bound by the rules.

      Other rules may further differentiate the treatment of rules
      violations from the treatment of violations of other types of

Rule 2109/1 (Power=2)
Agoran Contracts

      There exists a type of binding agreement known as Agoran
      Contract.  An Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by
      a Proposal and becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect.

      Unless otherwise specified in the Rules, all Players are bound
      by Agoran Contracts and no Player may leave an Agoran Contract
      while remaining a Player.  The Proposal process shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to agreements.

      All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
      Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

      The CotC is required to keep track of all Agoran Contracts.

Rule 1626/5 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any document, which has been submitted as an
      Application by some person, to a Player designed by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type.  The submittor is
      known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor before submission.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.
