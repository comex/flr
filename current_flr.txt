The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name Is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

History:
Created by Proposal 913, ca. May 4 1994
Transmuted from MI=1 to MI=Unanimity by Proposal 1020, Sep. 4 1994
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1484, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.
 CFJ 1132, Judged May 18, 1999: A Player failing to perform a duty
 required by the Rules within a reasonable time may be in violation
 of the Rules, even if the Rules do not provide a time limit for
 the performance of that duty.]

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 101, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1480, Mar. 15 1995
Amended(1) by Proposal 3915 (harvel), Sep. 27 1999

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/4 (Power=2)
Definition of Nomic Property

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity the value of
      which is defined by the Rules.  Other Rules may define
      procedures by which the value of a Nomic Property may be
      changed.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]

Rule 1527/3 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one action -- such as a
      notification, report, or other communication -- on which the
      Rules place some legal significance, the actions in that message
      shall be taken to have been sent sequentially in the order which
      they appear in the message.

      If a message attempts to perform multiple actions simultaneously
      without explicitly stating a specific order for the actions,
      then the attempt shall be considered ambiguous and without
      effect if the gamestate would be substantively different for any
      two orderings of the actions. For the purposes of this test, the
      actual order the actions are performed in is not considered
      substantive, but other differences may, at the discretion of a
      judge, be considered substantive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 754/4 (Power=1)
Spelling, Quoting, and Terminology

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning.  A Player shall not be
      penalised for accurately quoting a Rule, Proposal, Statement,
      Judgement, the words of another Player, or other reference.

      Except when the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have its
      standard mathematical meaning.  In particular, "number" shall
      mean "real number".

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

Rule 1497/7 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of evidence submitted in support of a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement, or in response to a Judicial or
      Appellate Order requiring that Player to disclose information
      known to that Player, commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of a public message, as any part of a response to a request for
      information where that Player was required to respond, or as
      part of a message to an Officer upon which that Officer is then
      required to act, commits the Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.

      For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be considered
      an Officer.

      For the purposes of this Rule, a false statement of fact is made
      "willfully" when the Player making it, at the time the statement
      was made, has the intention to make a false statement of fact
      and knowledge that the statement actually made was false.
      Particularly, a Player who makes a false statement of fact
      through excusable negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable
      reliance on the representations of another, shall not be
      considered to have willfully made a false statement of fact.

      A conclusion as to the interpretation of the Rules or their
      application to a particular situation is not a "statement of
      fact".

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

Rule 1926/1 (Power=1)
The Official Secrets Act

      The Rules may designate certain pieces of information to
      be secret. Any player who knowingly reveals secret information
      to another player, except as explicitly permitted or required
      by the rules, commits the Crime of Unlawful Disclosure, a Class
      5 Crime. All secret information is deemed private, with respect
      to the Freedom of Information Act.

Rule 1478/5 (Power=1)
Executors and Limited Executors

      (a) An Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
          Rules to act on behalf of that entity, who is called the
          Executee. There may be more than one such Player. An
          Executor of an Executee may perform on behalf of the
          Executee all such actions as the Rules permit the Executee
          to perform.

      (b) A Limited Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered
          by the Rules to perform on behalf of that entity a subset of
          the actions which the Rules permit the entity to perform. A
          Limited Executor is permitted to perform on behalf of an
          Executee only such actions as are explicitly permitted by
          the Rules.

      (c) A Player is always eir own Executor. Other entities have
          Executors (or Limited Executors) only as and when the Rules
          provide.

      (d) A Player acting on behalf of an entity other than emself
          must clearly indicate on whose behalf e is acting. A Player
          who does not clearly indicate that e is acting on behalf of
          some entity other than emself is presumed to be acting on
          eir own behalf.

      (e) Only persons may perform actions. Non-persons perform
          actions only via the agency of persons, as specified by the
          Rules.

Rule 1989/0 (Power=1)
Prime Executors

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

      (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime
          Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action must
          be an Executor of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that
          entity who is permitted to perform that action on behalf of
          that entity.

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.

Rule 1727/10 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June
      30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First
      Speaker Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think
          we may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules
          are invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was
      played on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official
      name of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the
      hard work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent
      advice of Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close as practical to Agora's
      Birthday (June 30 at 00:04:30 GMT+1200), the Payroll Clerk
      shall transfer 50 Stems from the Bank to each Player;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Payroll Clerk shall transfer
      25 Stems from the Bank to each Player who, during Agora's
      Birthday, publicly recognizes Agora's Birthday; but no Player
      shall receive more than one such transfer during each year's
      Birthday Celebration.

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to the
      Contestmaster of each such Contest 100 Stems;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of
      Appeals, Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's
      Birthday; nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the
      Courts a Call For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge,
      Judgement, call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's
      Birthday; nor shall any Player submit an Application to Submit
      an Opinion on Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do
      take place on Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this
      Rule does not deprive them of their usual effects.

Definition and Continuity of Entities

      No two Rule-defined entities shall have the same name or

      If the Rules defining some entity are repealed or amended
      such that they no longer define that entity, then that
      entity along with all its properties shall cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they
      still define that entity but with different properties,
      that entity and its properties shall continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

Rule 478/11 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      A Public Forum is a medium of communication so designated by
      the Registrar. Sending a message to a Public Forum shall be
      considered the equivalent of sending that message to all
      Players.

      A Discussion Forum is a medium of communication so designated
      by the Registrar. A Discussion Forum shall never be a Public
      Forum and messages sent to a Discussion Forum are never
      considered to have been sent to all Players.

      The Registrar may designate a given medium of communication to
      be (or cease to be) a Public Forum or a Discussion Forum Without
      Objection. An announcement of such a designation shall be made
      via the medium whose designation is being changed. Any
      designation of a medium as a Public Forum shall also be
      announced via all existing Public Fora in addition to any
      other requirements.

      It is the responsibility of every Active Player to ensure that
      e is able to receive messages via each and every Public Forum.
      Any inability of a Player to receive messages via a particular
      Public Forum does not deprive that medium of its legal status
      as a Public Forum. Players are in no way required to receive
      messages via any particular Discussion Forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all media
      which are currently Public or Discussion Fora and sufficient
      data regarding each medium to allow new Players to receive
      messages via that medium.

      Any communication which has been sent via a Public Forum shall
      be considered to have been made publicly. Any communication
      which has been sent to all Players via some other medium, or
      combination of mediums, shall be considered to have been made
      publicly, provided it contains some clear designation that it
      is intended to be public.

      If the Rules require a Player to publish certain information,
      then e is considered to have satisfied that requirement at the
      time e publicly sends a message containing the information e is
      required to publish.

      If the Rules require a Player to announce certain information,
      that announcement must be made publicly.

[CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
 all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.
 CFJ 813: A Player need not prove that e can receive the PF.
 CFJ 831: The Date: header of a message is not necessarily the time
 at which the message takes effect.
 CFJ 1112, Judged TRUE Jan. 21 1999: "In order to submit a Proposal,
 in the sense of R1865 and elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a
 collection of text 'with the clear indication that that text is
 intended to become a Proposal' (R1483) merely be sent to the Public
 Forum by a Proposing Entity; the collection of text must also be
 received in the Public Forum."]

      value Unanimity.

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

      Power is an Index.  An Instrument is an entity with nonzero
      Power.  The Power of a given entity is zero unless otherwise
      defined by the Rules.

Rule 1869/1 (Power=3)
Restrictions on Setting Power

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

Rule 1023/14 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform an action "as soon
      as possible", then e is required to perform the action within
      a week.

      A Player who fails to observe this requirement commits the
      Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness.  All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a penalty.

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      Inactive Players without conflicting with this Rule.

[CFJ 1075: Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with
 lower precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
 purely discussionary nature.]

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

[CFJ 790 contains a detailed discussion on what does and does not
 qualify as a random choice.]

Rule 1769/2 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 17 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins within
      72 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays and the
      time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless this
      would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 17 days in length, in
      which case the first Holiday is extended to 17 days and the
      second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power (low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858)
 Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule of higher Power to
 mean something other than its ordinary English meaning, that
 may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does must be
 decided on a case-by-case basis.]

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

[CFJs 1114 and 1115 (both Judged Feb. 5 1999): This Rule is to be
 applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just
 because a Rule is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict
 with a Rule of higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is
 nullified in all cases.]

Rule 1513/4 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      The Rules may grant to certain entities the power to require
      Players to perform (or refrain from performing) actions.  Such
      Entities shall have whatever power is granted to them by the
      Rules.  In the event that the requirements of such an Entity
      conflicts with the Rules, the Rules shall always take
      precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity mentioned
      first in that Rule takes precedence over the others.

      No entity (including any body of text) may require a Player to
      perform or refrain from performing any action unless that
      Player has previously been provided with the information of
      which actions may be required of or prohibited em by that
      entity.

Rule 869/11 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      Any person who is not registered as a Player may do so by
      sending a message to a Public Forum stating that e registers as
      a Player.  Unless other Rules provide additional necessary
      conditions for registration that have not been fulfilled or the
      Rules otherwise prohibit the person from registering, e
      immediately becomes a registered Player.

      Each Player is always either Ready or Unready, but not both.  A
      Player is Ready unless the Rules state otherwise.  If a Player
      is Unready, e may become Ready by announcing that e does so.

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 12 previous months, e becomes Unready and is subject
      to a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration
      and ends two months afterwards.  A Player is only subject to the
      Grace Period resulting from eir own registration.

      Whenever a Player's Grace Period ends, e becomes Ready.

[CFJ 805: "Person" here means a natural person, not a legal person
 (such as a corporation) or something named "person."
 CFJ 1263: Any message expressing a clear desire or intent to register
 as a Player counts as a request for registration, whether or not it
 is explicitly phrased as a request.]

Rule 1042/16 (Power=1)
Deregistration Due to Silence

      Each player is always Noisy, Quiet, or Silent, but never more
      than one of these.  Whenever a player registers or posts to a
      public forum, that player is Noisy.

      A player who has not within the most recent 24 hours caused
      another player to become Quiet may cause another Active Noisy
      player to become Quiet by sending a message to a public forum in
      which e identifies the player and states that e causes that
      player to become Quiet.  Whenever a player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks or has been Inactive continuously for
      two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any player may publicly allege that some other player has
      abandoned the game.  A player has abandoned the game if and only
      if e is Silent.  As soon as possible after a public allegation
      that a player has abandoned the game, the Registrar shall
      publicly confirm or deny the allegation.

      If the allegation is confirmed, then the following events shall
      occur in order:

       (i) if the Silent player is the Speaker, e commits the Class 15
           Crime of Speaker Abandonment and ceases to be Speaker, and
           the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker;

      (ii) the Silent player is deregistered.

      The Silent player shall be deemed to have been deregistered as
      of the timestamp of the message from the Registrar confirming
      the allegation.

Rule 1789/2 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Write of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

Rule 1755/6 (Power=1)
No Non-Player Responsibilities

      Whenever a player is deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate,
      officer, judge, or in general to occupy any role or position to
      which the rules assign any duties or powers.  No one who is not
      registered may occupy such a role or position, unless at least
      one of the rules defining the role or position explicitly
      indicate it may be occupied by a nonplayer.

      Bearing a Patent Title shall not be deemed to be occupying a
      role or position.

      This rule shall not act to prevent a nonplayer from registering,
      calling for judgement, or otherwise doing things that nonplayers
      are generally able to do.

Rule 1841/4 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      (a) A Player (the Grantor) who has been continuously registered
          for more than two months is empowered to give eir Power of
          Attorney (PoA) to another Player (the Holder), as specified
          in this Rule.

      (b) The Holder holds the Grantor's PoA if all of the following
          conditions are met:
          (1) the Grantor has announced that e grants eir PoA to the
              Holder;
          (2) the Holder has, in the week immediately preceding or
              immediately following the Grantor's announcement,
              publically consented to hold the Grantor's PoA;
          (3) the Holder is Active; and
          (4) the grant of PoA has not been withdrawn for any of the
              reasons listed in (d).

      (c) The grant of PoA commences at the time the Grantor grants
          eir PoA to the Holder, or at the time the Holder consents to
          the grant, or at the time specified by the Grantor,
          whichever is latest. If the Grantor specifies a time at
          which the grant of PoA is to commence, it must be a time no
          more than seven says from the Grantor's announcement. Later
          specifications are without effect for the purposes of this
          Rule.

              expires;
          (2) the Grantor publically withdraws the grant;
          (3) the Grantor is deregistered;
          (4) the Holder is deregistered or goes On Hold; or
          (5) the Holder has held the PoA continuously for three
              months.

      (e) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed as preventing other
          Rules from granting and withdrawing PoA by other means.

      (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
          has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
          shall be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect.

Rule 1431/15 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a public message to the effect that a
      specific public communication misrepresents the actual Game
      State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error posting publicly either a denial
      of the Claim or an admission of the Claim. If the Claim is
      admitted, then the Player making the admission is required to
      post a corrected version of the relevant portion of the message
      which was in error, before one week passes from the time the
      Claim of Error was made. A Player who admits a Claim but does
      not publish a correction is deemed not to have Responded to that
      Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error
       * the Claim is in dispute

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the allotted time
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Delayed COE Response, to be
      reported by the Player who posted the Claim. A Player who
      incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim commits the Crime of
      Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the
      Claim within 72 hours after the incorrect denial.

[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]

        i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally

           holding the Office.
      iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be

      permissible to Ratify.

      A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by

Rule 1551/5 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time the Document was
      published.  In other words, the State of the Game, upon such
      ratification, becomes that specified within the Document, plus
      all subsequent legal changes between the time of its publication
      and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published, even
      to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or illegal move, or an
      Order.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
      allow such retroactive alterations or corrections to the Game
      State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified.

Rule 1552/3 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published.  (A requirement
              that it be sent to all Players fulfills this criterion.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

Electees and Removal from Office

      A Player who wins an Election for an Office, or is installed

      as well as its holder.

      When the Electee to an Office is retired from that Office, e
      ceases to be the Electee to that Office, but continues to hold
      the Office.

      When the Electee to an Office is removed from that Office, e
      ceases to be Electee to that Office. Furthermore, if the Electee
      currently holds the Office, the Speaker becomes the holder of
      that Office, unless another Rule provides that a different
      Player is to hold the Office.

      When a non-Electee is removed from an Office and there is an
      Electee to that Office, then the Electee becomes the holder of
      the Office. If there is no Electee, the Office is held by the
      Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, e is
      removed from all Offices e holds.

      Unless otherwise specified, the Term of Service for an Office
      shall expire on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
      the month in which the Officer in question was elected to that
      Office.  At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service, the

Rule 1758/6 (Power=1)
Holding an Office in Perpetuity

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,
      then the Assistant Director of Personnel may declare, Without
      Objection, that that Player holds that Office in perpetuity.
      The Player then holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office.  If
      a Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office
      to another Player, and e is still the Electee to the Office at
      the end of the Period of Delegation, then e resumes holding the
      Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

      the named successor becomes holder of the Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who

Rule 1645/8 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      The Electee to an Office or the Speaker, if e holds that Office,
      is permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
      that Office. This is called Delegation. The Player doing the
      appointing is herein referred to as the Delegating Player and
      the Player so appointed is herein referred to as the Delegated
      Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (a) the Delegating Player has published a Notice of Delegation,
          naming the Office being Delegated and the Delegated Player;

      (b) the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
          Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;

      (c) the Delegated Player has published a Notice of Consent to
          Delegation for that Office during the seven days immediately
          preceding or immediately following the publishing of the
          Notice of Delegation.

      (d) the Delegating Player is still permitted to Delegate the
          Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;

      (e) the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
          concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes when any of the following occur:

      (a) a Player other than the Delegating Player becomes the
          Electee to the Office;
      (b) the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player as the
          end of the Period of Delegation is reached; or
      (c) the Delegated Office has been continuously Delegated for
          three weeks.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases to
      hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office, and earns the Salary for that Office as described in
      other Rules.

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Electee to the
      Office commences holding the Office, if the Office has an
      Electee. If the Office has no Electee, then the Delegated Player
      continues to hold the Office.

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to

      The Officer is Impeached when such a Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voters do not include the Officer
      under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must be
      greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Rule 1665/2 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class 4
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

Rule 1585/2 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the

      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 1061 (Judged TRUE, Nov. 2 1997): "Rule 1585 should be interpreted
 such that a Player who is newly installed into an Office does not
 commit the Infraction of Failure to Report (insofar as that Office is
 subject to such duties) if e posts the required Report within a week
 of eir being installed into Office."

      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to

Rule 1728/9 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is Dependent (or may be performed Dependently) if
      and only if it is an Action With N Objections or an Action
      With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer not greater
      than five.  The phrase `Without Objection' is synonymous with
      `Without 1 Objection', and the phrase `With Support' is
      synonymous with `With 1 Supporter'.  The Rules may name
      specific actions as Dependent Actions.

      A Player may, in a Public Forum, unambiguously describe a
      particular Dependent Action which e is authorised by the
      Rules to perform Dependently, and announce eir intent to
      perform it.  That Player may perform that action if and only if:

      (a)  e announced eir intent at most fourteen days before
            attempting to perform it, and, in the case of Actions
            Without N Objections, at least four days before attempting
            to perform it;

      (b)  the authorising Rule explicitly indicates who may perform
           the action Dependently;

      (c)  during the time between the announcement made under
           (a) of this Rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  fewer than N Players have publicly posted Objections
                to the performance of the action, if the action is to
                be performed Without N Objections; or

           (2)  at least N Players other than the Player attempting to
                make the action have publicly posted Support for
                the performance of the action, if the action is to be
                performed With N Supporters; and

      (d)  e publicly announces that e performs the described action.

      Properties which would be changed by a Dependent Action
      do not occur until announced as in (d).

      The specification in the Rules that an action may be
      performed Dependently in no way prohibits performing that
      same action if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      Rules calling for Dependent Actions may restrict the eligibility
      of Players to Support or Object to that specific Action.

Rule 1664/19 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      A Rebellious player may Call for a Revolt at any time by
      publicly announcing e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if no other Call for Revolt has been made that week
      and no successful Revolt has occurred for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and publicly announce the result.

      The Registrar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of players (plus 1 if Miscreant is Borne). If this number is
      less than or equal to the number of Rebellious players (plus
      1 if Miscreant is Borne by a Rebellious player), then the
      Revolt succeeds; otherwise it fails. All numbers used in this
      calculation are determined at the time of the Call for Revolt.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur in order:

         - The Registrar shall expunge the Blots of each Rebellious
           player
         - The Registrar shall pay out 40 Stems to each Rebellious
           player
         - The GWotO shall remove all Abiding Oligarchs from the
           Oligarchy
         - Each Abiding player that is the Electee to an Office is
           retired from that Office.
         - All Rebellious players become Abiding again
         - The Registrar shall levy a 75% Indulgence tax.  For this
           levy, the Bearor of the Patent Title "Robespierre" is
           tax-exempt.
         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - Any Indulgence Auction in progress is cancelled

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious players gain 2 Blots.
         - The player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The effects of a Call for Revolt shall be based on the Political
      Status, Oligarchy membership, and Indulgence holdings of players
      at the time of the Call.

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all Blots gained or
      expunged as a result of this Rule.

            of determining success if, during that Bastille Day, e
            publicly hums a few bars of 'La Marseillaise'.

            This includes the determination of the number of players,
            and the Miscreant adjustment, which may become 2 rather
            than 1.

        ii) On success, rather than having all eir Blots expunged,
            each Rebellious Player shall be left with 1 Blot each,
            even if e was previously Immaculate.

      publicly announcing e does so, provided e has not changed eir
      Political Status during the current month. A new players is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player.

      At the beginning of each month, each Rebellious Player commits
      the Class 2 Infraction of Inciting to Riot (to be reported by
      the Registrar), unless all of the following are true at that
      time:

        i) The Registrar has not announced whether the last Call for
           Revolt succeeded or failed.
       ii) The Player was Rebellious at the time of the last Call for
           Revolt.
      iii) The Player has not changed from Abiding to Rebellious since
           the last Call for Revolt.

      in which case the Player is Hauled Into Kangaroo Court instead.

      When a Call for Revolt fails, each Player Hauled Into Kangaroo
      Court since the Call for Revolt commits the Infraction of
      Inciting to Riot, as defined above.

Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals, the Proposal Pool,
  and the Currency of Papyri.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/9 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute
      publishes a body of text with the clear indication that it is
      intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text becomes a
      Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes the
      Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as Proposing or
      submitting a Proposal.

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.

      The publishing of the Proposal Pool never creates new
      Proposals.

      All Players are Legislators.  A Player is Mute while e has more
      than 5 Blots.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply Rule
      Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even Rule
      Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in valid media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.  For
      the purposes of this rule, print and electronic media, including
      mailing lists, are valid media.

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

Rule 594/3 (Power=2)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

The Proposal Pool

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Pool.

      A Proposal's Distribution Cost is an integer multiple of the MUQ
      of Papyri. The base Distribution Cost of a Proposal is 1, but
      this may be altered by other Rules.

[CFJ 10: A Proposal remains a Proposal even if the Promotor changes
 before the Proposal is distributed.]

Rule 1952/1 (Power=1)
Making Proposals Distributable

      Each Proposal is either Distributable or Undistributable.
      Initially, each Proposal is Undistributable. When a Proposal
      becomes Disinterested, it immediately becomes Distributable
      and may not become Undistributable by any means as long as
      it remains Disinterested.

      Any Player may make any Undistributable Proposal in the Proposal
      Pool Distributable by publicly announcing that e is doing so and
      Paying a Fee of a number of Papyri equal to the amount of the
      Distribution Cost of the Proposal. Any Player may make any
      Interested Distributable Proposal in the Proposal Pool
      Undistributable by publicly announcing that e is doing so and
      Paying a Fee of a number of Papyri double the amount of the
      Distribution Cost of the Proposal.

      Any Monk may make any Undistributable Proposal in the Proposal
      Pool Distributable by publicly announcing that e is doing so and
      Paying a Fee of a number of Papyri equal to half the amount of
      the Distribution Cost of the Proposal, rounded up.

Rule 1770/14 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      During each Week, the Promotor must either distribute every
      Proposal that was Distributable at the beginning of that Week,
      or announce that there were no such Proposals. Failure to do so
      is the Class 1 Infraction of Promotor Tardiness, which any
      Player may detect and report.

      The distribution of each Proposal shall be accompanied by the
      identity of its Proposing Entity, and an indication of whether
      the Proposal is Ordinary or Democratic. However, the failure of
      the Promotor to distribute any of these accompaniments with a
      Proposal does not deprive the distribution of the Proposal of
      any legal effect.

      A Proposal is legally distributed only if it is explicitly
      marked as such. When a Proposal is distributed, it is removed
      from the Proposal Pool.

      The Promotor shall not distribute any Proposal which is not
      Distributable, and must abort any Proposal so distributed. If
      the Promotor aborts a Proposal which e knows was Distributable
      at the time it was distributed, e commits the Class 2 Crime of
      Illegal Abortion.

      The Promotor aborts a Proposal by publishing an announcement to
      that effect, clearly identifying the Proposal which has been
      aborted.  When a Proposal is aborted:

      (a)  the Voting Period for that Proposal immediately ends, if it
           has not ended already;
      (b)  all Votes cast on that Proposal are cancelled, and the
           Proposal fails;
      (c)  the Assessor is relieved of any duty to report on Votes
           cast on that Proposal; and
      (d)  the Proposal is added to the Proposal Pool.

      The distribution of an Undistributable Proposal, when the
      Promotor knows that the Proposal is Undistributable, is the
      Class 2 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation. The distribution of
      a text purporting to be a Proposal, when the Promotor knows that
      the text is not a Proposal, is the Class 5 Crime of Promotor
      Fraud.

[In upholding the Judgement of CFJ 1089, the Board of Appeals held
 that in order for a Proposal to have been legally distributed, it is
 necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) that some text with
 demonstrably the same effects as the Proposal have been distributed.]

Opposite Proposals

      Each time the Promotor distributes Proposals, e shall first

      the Target.  E may then distribute with these Proposals an
      Opposite Proposal for the Target.  If e does so, e may, Without
      2 Objections, pay out 0.1 Papyri to eirself.

      An Opposite Proposal should be clearly marked as such.  It
      should be substantially the opposite, in spirit or effect, of
      its Target.  An Opposite Proposal shall have the same status as
      its Target, including AI, Sanity, Insanity, Urgentness,
      Disinterestedness, and Democraticity; except that, if the Target
      does not have an AI of at least 2, the Opposite Proposal shall
      be neither Democratic nor Sane.

      The Promotor shall be considered to be the proposer of the
      Opposite Proposal, but shall incur no penalties as a result of
      being its proposer.  This Rule takes precedence over all Rules
      which would impose such penalties.

Rule 1726/1 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is submitted by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its submission, it takes effect when submitted.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

Rule 1934/4 (Power=2)
The Speaker, Sanity, and Buying Democracy

      An Untainted Speaker may, with 3 Supporters, Sanitise an Interested
      Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary Proposal, for
      which the Voting Period has not yet concluded, and which has
      never been the subject of an Attempt to Democratise.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised before its Voting Period commences,
      said Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, becomes a Sane Proposal,
      and has its Distribution Cost modified as required by other Rules.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised during its Voting Period, said
      Proposal is not modified until at least one Papyrus is publicly
      transferred to the Bank solely for this stated purpose by any
      Player during the Proposal's Voting Period.  If this happens,
      the Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, the Proposal becomes
      a Sane Proposal, and all votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Assessor shall announce that the Proposal has
      been successfully Sanitised; the Voting Period of the Proposal
      is extended to end seven days after this announcement.

      Any Player may, With Support, make an Attempt to Democratise an
      Interested Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary
      Proposal, and for which the Voting Period has not yet concluded.
      There is a Fee of 0.1 VEs for a Player other than an Untainted
      Speaker to make an Attempt to Democratise.  This Fee must be
      paid publicly.

      Once an Attempt to Democratise a Proposal has been made, until
      the end of the Proposal's Voting Period, any Player may publicly
      transfer any number of VEs to the Bank with a clear, unambiguous
      statement that this transfer is made solely for the purpose of
      Democratising the Proposal, or solely for the purpose of keeping
      the Proposal Ordinary.

      At the end of the Voting Period, Democratisation succeeds if at
      least as many VEs have been publicly transferred to the Bank for
      Democratisating the Proposal as for keeping the Proposal
      Ordinary.  The Assessor shall announce as soon as possible after
      the end of the Voting Period whether or not Democratisation of
      that Proposal has succeeded.

      If Democratisation does not succeed, the Voting Period is
      considered to have ended as usual.  The Attempt does not in any
      way modify the Proposal in question.

      If Democratisation succeeds, the Proposal becomes a Democratic
      Proposal, and all Votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Voting Period for that Proposal is considered
      not to have ended (except for the purposes of this Attempt to
      Democratise), and is extended to end seven days after the
      Assessor's announcement that Democratisation has succeeded.

Voting Power

      (a) An entity's Voting Power on an Ordinary Proposal is as

            (1) An Oligarch: one;
            (2) Any other entity: zero.

      (b) An entity's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as
          follows:

            (1) A Player: one plus the number of Voting Entitlements e
                possesses rounded down, minus one for every five Blots
                e has, with a minimum of zero and a maximum of:
                 (a) for an Oligarch, two;
                 (b) for a non-Oligarch, five.
            (2) The Bank: zero;
            (3) Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
                default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting
                power on a Democratic Proposal for that entity.

      (c) The value of an entity's Voting Power on Ordinary and
          Democratic Proposals at the beginning of each Week shall be
          in effect for all Proposals distributed during that
          Week. However, if a Proposal is made Democratic after it has
          been distributed, the Voting Power of each entity for that
          Proposal is redetermined at the time the Proposal is made
          Democratic.

      (d) An entity may cast as many votes as e wishes on a Proposal,
          up to the limit determined by that entity's Voting Power on
          that Proposal, with the exception that no Player may vote on
          an Ordinary Proposal unless e is an Oligarch at the time e
          casts eir vote. An entity may cast its votes in any
          combination e wishes.

      cancelled by the Voter which cast it, although it may be
      cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

Rule 1764/12 (Power=1)
Modes of Voting

      There are three classes of Issues: Proposals, Elections, and
      Referenda.

      (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
          Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the
          prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.

      (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
               for Proposals, with Support.

           (2) The Assistant Director of Personnel may change the
               prevailing mode of voting for Elections, with Support.

           (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

      (c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of
          voting for that particular Issue is permanently set to the
          prevailing mode for that class of Issue.

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voters on that
               Issue, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
               Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may only be achieved by sending a
               message privately to the Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may be achieved by sending a message
               either publicly or privately.

      (e) If the mode of voting is Private or Unrestricted, then the
          status of any votes cast privately is secret until the
          end of the voting period.

[CFJ 1124, Judged TRUE Apr. 26 1999: "Votes sent to the
 agora-discussion mailing list are neither 'sent publically' nor 'sent
 privately', and so are not valid when voting is Unrestricted."]

Rule 1729/3 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

CFJ 1178, Judged TRUE Nov. 18 1999: "Rule 1729 permits voting on
Insane Proposals by private message to the Assessor, even when the
prevailing mode of voting on Proposals is Public."

[CFJ 1078, Judged TRUE 8 January 1998: "Morendil violated Rule 1729 by

The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue which is not an
      Ordinary Proposal, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by
      publicly stating so. An Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

      Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
      Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
      cancelled.

Rule 879/13 (Power=2)
Quorum

      An Ordinary Proposal achieves Quorum if at least three
      Oligarchs cast votes on it.

      A Democratic Proposal achieves Quorum if:
      (1) at least one-third of all Active Players, or
      (2) at least one-fifth of all Players
      cast votes on it. Quorum for a Democratic Proposal shall be
      determined from the number of Players and number of Active

Rule 955/5 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

Rule 1965/1 (Power=2)
Complacent Oligarchy

      As soon as possible after an Ordinary Proposal fails Quorum, the
      Assessor shall publish a Notice of Complacency to that effect.

      Publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency results
      in a copy of the Proposal being added to the Proposal Pool. This
      new Proposal is Democratic and Distributable, and is deemed to
      have been submitted by the entity that submitted the Ordinary
      Proposal.

      If an Ordinary Proposal has achieved Quorum, publication by the
      Assessor of a Notice of Complacency for that Proposal is the
      Class 2 Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a

      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value

      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a

          which, as part of all of its effect, repeals one or more
          Rules, and if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
          simplifies the Ruleset, then the Rulekeepor shall pay out 30
          Stems to the Proposer of that Proposal. If the Rulekeepor
          decides that the Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e
          must announce this decision.

      (b) When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not

          the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections, provided
          the procedure for doing so is initiated within one week of
          the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  As soon as
          possible after the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this

Referenda and Elections
  This Category includes Rules regulating voting on entities
  other than Proposals, particularly Referenda and Elections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1434/8 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for
      collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      Unless otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Vote
      Collector.

      * Voters: Only Active Players may Vote on a Referendum.
      Activity is measured at the time a Player sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal public announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement must
      include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from publishing
      at any time a list of those Players who have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall publish, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      Adoption Index for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the
      Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption Index
      for a Referendum is 1.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voters
      at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller fraction
      voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are published.

      If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered before the
      Voting Period ends, the Election has no Winner.

      Election. On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
      makes or attempts to make a Nomination.

      * Nomination: A Nominator makes a Nomination by sending a
      message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period
      indicating for which Election e is Nominating.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the
      Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to retract eir
      Nomination.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
      Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for the
      Election.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
      Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside of
      the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * Announcing Candidates : the Vote Collector shall publicly
      announce, as soon as possible after the Nominating Period is
      over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
      Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
      standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
      exceptions :

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
      Candidates for the given Election. Words which are effectively
      synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most votes were cast. If there is more than one such
      candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those candidates as the
      winner, and must publicly announce eir chosen candidate as
      winner.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is
      not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, the Election has no Winner.

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

Budgets

      A Budget is a document maintained by a particular Office, whose

      explicitly required or permitted by the Rules.

      An Office has a Budget only if the Rules explicitly designate
      one.  Each Budget shall be part of the Monthly Reports of its
      Maintainer.  The Maintainer shall publish the Budget as soon as
      possible whenever it changes.

      If a current Budget is discovered to be invalid, then its
      Maintainer shall create a valid one as soon as possible.  This
      valid one should be as close as possible to the most recent
      valid version of the Budget.

      While holding an Office as Electee, an Officer may amend its
      Budget Without Objection; the Rules regarding a particular
      Budget may specify a different procedure for its amendment.

      end of the Nomination Period.  A Proto-Budget is valid if it
      would be valid as a Budget.

      When the Voting Period begins, the Vote Collector shall announce
      each Candidate's last valid Proto-Budget.

      When the Voting Period ends, the Winner's last valid
      Proto-Budget becomes the Budget of that Office, and e shall
      announce it as soon as possible.  If the Election ends without a

Rule 1835/2 (Power=1)
Standing Down

      During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
      Election may stand down, by posting a public message to that
      effect. The player is then no longer to be considered a
      Candidate for that Election. Any further votes cast in eir
      favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

      Any votes cast for a Player who stands down are cancelled, and
      any Player who cast such a vote is considered to have declared
      eir Presence in that Election.  Additionally, any Player who
      cast such a vote may vote again, unless e has already cast
      another vote which remains uncancelled, and this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would prevent such a vote.

      If, at any time during the Voting Period of an Election, there
      remains only a single Candidate, the Voting Period ends
      immediately, with the sole remaining Candidate as the winner
      of that Election.

Applications
  This Category includes Rules concerning Applications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1626/4 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any document which has been clearly labeled as
      an Application and which has been submitted as an Application by
      some person.  That person is known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor.

      An Application is submitted by sending it to a Player designed
      by the Rules to receive Applications of that particular type,
      bearing a clear indication that the document in question is
      intended to be an Application and that it is being submitted by
      the Sponsor as an Application.  If the Rules do not otherwise
      designate a Player to receive a particular type of Application,
      the Speaker shall do so.  The effect of submitting an valid
      Application is determined by the Rules pertaining to
      Applications of that particular type.

      A person who submits an Application with signatures attached
      belonging to any person who has not consented to having eir
      signature attached to that Application commits the Class 4 Crime
      of Application Fraud.  An Application submitted with attached
      signatures belonging to a person who did not consent to such
      attachment is invalid.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

      It shall be a defense to the Crime of Application Fraud that the
      Sponsor did not receive a signatory's notice of revocation.

Orders
  This Category includes Rules concerning Orders generally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause
      the Player to be convicted of a Crime or penalized, as
      described, for said action.

Classes of Orders

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
          (1) the Speaker; or
          (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency.

Rule 1795/3 (Power=1)
Timing Requirements of Orders

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      Other Rules may establish other times by which Orders must be
      performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

      who executed it. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Rule 1800/0 (Power=1)
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1801/0 (Power=1)
Stay of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
      expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
      which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
      made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

Vacation of Orders

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the

      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

Appeal of Administrative and Private Orders

      is improperly or invalidly executed.

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

Rule 1810/3 (Power=1)
Noncompliance with Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.

      If an Order requires an entity to perform an action prior to a
      specified time, and the Order is not satisfied prior to that
      time specified in the Order commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Contempt by Inaction.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisfaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Calling for Judgement
  This Category includes Rules regulating calling for Judgement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/4 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any person may seek formal resolution of any dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the
      Clerk of the Courts or Justiciar.  Any document submitted to the
      Clerk of the Courts or Justiciar and which is clearly marked as
      a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.  (Although any CFJ
      may be filed with the Justiciar, Players are encouraged to file
      with the CotC unless there is a good reason not to.)

      For the purpose of this and other Rules, the submission of a CFJ
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a CFJ along with any
      additional material submitted by the Caller (including, but not
      limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not later than the time e
      announces the identity of the first Judge assigned to Judge it.
      However, if the CFJ is submitted to the Justiciar, e shall
      perform all duties of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to
      that CFJ.

Barring Players from Judgement

      The Caller of a CFJ may Bar up to three Players from Judging
      that CFJ.

      Any Player whose Executor is the Caller of a CFJ is Barred from
      Judging that CFJ.

      Any Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that
      CFJ.

Excess CFJs

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      A Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Class 1
      Infraction of Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the
      Courts.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ.  Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Class 2 Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing,
      to be reported by the Justiciar.

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Selecting a Judge
  This Category includes Rules describing how a Judge is selected
  for a CFJ.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1868/2 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge and announce eir
      selection.  This selection shall be made from amongst all
      those Players eligible to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once selected as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is Recused from that CFJ or becomes
      ineligible to Judge that particular CFJ.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

CFJ 1186, Judged TRUE Dec. 9 1999: "The Clerk of the Courts is
required by Rule 1868 to select a Judge who is eligible at the time
that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
eligible at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced."

[CFJ 1187, Judged TRUE Dec. 8 1999: "A Judge is considered to be
 assigned to Judge a particular CFJ at the time that the Clerk of the

Rule 698/7 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to judge a given Call for
      Judgement (CFJ) unless specifically made ineligible by some
      Rule.

      Whenever a Player becomes subject to a Grace Period, e shall be
      considered to have made emself ineligible to judge CFJs, as
      described in other Rules.

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to judge that CFJ.

      If, after taking all other Rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to judge a CFJ, then all
      Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players Barred by
      the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding
      the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall
      be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to judge, and the Caller is a Player, then the Caller
      shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to judge, then the Caller has happened across an Agora
      without any Players.  The Rules suggest that the Caller try
      calling at a later date.

      This Rule can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of Rules
      which would result in there being no Players eligible to
      Judge a given CFJs.

      Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then all Players made
      ineligible by this rule become eligible again.

Rule 1567/9 (Power=1)
Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ

      CFJ or type of CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the
      Courts, specifying the CFJ or type of CFJ for which e wishes to
      be made ineligible.  Such a notice remains in effect until the
      Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no longer in
      effect.

      If a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge of a CFJ for
      which e has already been selected as Judge, e commits the Class

Late Judgement

      The Deliberation Period for a CFJ begins when the Clerk of the
      Courts announces the identity of the Judge, and ends seven days
      later.

      In the week following the end of the Deliberation Period, if the
      Judge has not yet returned Judgement or Dismissed the CFJ, then
      the Clerk of the Courts may recuse the Judge from the CFJ and
      assign it to a new Judge, by posting an announcement to that
      effect.

      A Judge who Judges or Dismisses a CFJ after the end of the
      Deliberation Period, but before being recused as a Judge,
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Judging a Bit Late, to be
      detected and reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

      A Judge who has neither Judged nor Dismissed a CFJ seven days
      after the end of its Deliberation Period is automatically
      recused from that CFJ.

      A Judge who is recused from a CFJ in accordance with this Rule
      commits the Class 3 Infraction of Failure to Judge (to be

      FALSE.  Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall publish the Judgement.

      If a Judge delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of

      Courts shall pay out to the Judge the Judicial Salary as
      soon as possible after the publication of eir Judgement.

[In the Judgement of CFJ 794, the CotC determined that a Judgement
 of the form "If X then TRUE else FALSE" is legal only if the truth-

Rule 1565/9 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must publicly post a notice of the dismissal and the
      Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary.

[CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
 should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been
 set aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new
 Judge selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to
 deliver a Judgement.]

      The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
      improperly or invalidly executed, order that that Order be

      A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as

Rule 1827/3 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
      when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, e
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Slow Motion, detected and
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts. If this occurs, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one as
      usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is no longer a Player or is On Hold, then
      a new Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that

      perform that duty instead.

      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or

      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order

      agreement be binding under the Rules and that the agreement has
      in fact been broken, e may Order the breaching party to:
      (1) transfer Property to the other party or parties to remedy

      justice.

Rule 1365/7 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application

      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon submission, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be submitted no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been submitted and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Rule 911/9 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E is not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

Initiating Appeals

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or

      addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
      has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
      required to perform.

      In all cases, the public insistence of any three Players is
      sufficient to initiate the appeal of a particular matter.  In
      the case of the appeal of a Judicial Order, the insistence of
      any Player bound by the Order is sufficient.  In the case of a
      Judgement which convicts a Player of a Crime, the insistence of
      the convicted Player is sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

Rule 1447/16 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Class 3 Infraction of Failing to Judge
      an Appeal, detected and reported by the Cotc. A Justice who does
      not submit eir determination to the CotC within seven days is
      immediately recused as a Justice from that Board. In this case
      the CotC must randomly select an eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall publish these determinations along with
      any arguments, evidence, or other material included with those
      determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      If a Justice submits eir determination to the Clerk of the
      Courts before the end of the assigned deliberation period,
      then the Clerk of the Courts shall pay out to that Justice
      the Judicial Salary as soon as possible after the publication
      of eir determination.

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

Rule 1694/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Dismissal

      If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
      consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical

      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

Titles for Rules

      Each Rule has a Title, which is a single line of text

Patent Titles

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/14 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person
      is said to Bear that Patent Title; the Patent Title is Borne
      by the person, and the person is its Bearor.  When a Patent
      Title is revoked from a person, that person ceases to Bear that
      Patent Title.  The status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be
      changed as explicitly set out in the Rules. Only persons may
      Bear Patent Titles.

      As soon as possible after a Patent Title award or revocation
      which occurs automatically occurs, the Herald shall publicly
      announce that such an award or revocation has occurred, and
      which Title has been awarded to or revoked from which person or
      persons.

      Unless otherwise specified, each Patent Title has Historical
      Significance.  The Herald may, Without Objection, cause that
      Title to lose its Historical Significance.  That Title
      immediately gains Hysterical Significance.

           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the production,
           distribution, and marketing of panaceas and other patent
           medicines.

      (c)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for one Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as 1, with 2 Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with 3 Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus 2 Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

       (d) Filthy Bureaucrat, to be awarded to any player who at some
           point simultaneously holds and is Electee to three or more
           Offices.

Degrees

      for any official or unofficial business if and only if e
      currently Bears that Degree.

      Persons may come to Bear Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person Bears a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default
      properties of Patent Titles.

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
      Player who has been awarded a Degree Bears that Degree.

How to Get a Degree

      A Degree is Granted by the operation of an instrument of

Property

      Any entity which the Rules permit to be possessed by another

      the terms "possessor" and "owner" are synonymous, as are
      "possess" and "own".  Individual Properties may not be created
      or destroyed, or their ownership changed, except in accordance
      with the Rules.

      Every Property shall have a Recordkeepor, which is some Player
      who is required to retain a record of who owns that Property.
      If, for a given Property, no other Rule provides otherwise, or
      if the Rules would otherwise provide for a person who is not a
      Player, the Treasuror shall maintain this record. If one of the
      Official duties of an Officer is to be the Recordkeepor of a
      Property, then eir Report shall include this record and any
      changes thereto since the last posting of eir Report.

          Executor and all debts for that type of property that the
          Dissolute had when e lost eir Prime Executor have been

Embezzlement and Receiving Stolen Property

      (a) A transfer of Property from one entity to another entity
          which is made without being explicitly required or permitted
          by the Rules is unauthorized.

      (b) A Player who intentionally makes a valid but unauthorized
          transfer of Property from any entity to another entity
          commits the Class 10 Crime of Embezzlement.

      (c) An entity which receives Property from any entity as the
          result of an intentional, valid and unauthorized transfer
          incurs a debt to the transferor for all such Property.

      (d) A Player who has been informed that e, or an entity of which
          e is the Prime Executor, has incurred a debt of the type
          decribed in
          (c) and who does not act to satisfy that debt within in a week of
          being informed of it commits the Class 10 Crime of Receiving
          Stolen Property.

      (e) For the the purposes of this Rule, a valid but unauthorized
          transfer is considered to have been made intentionally if
          and only if, at the time of the transfer, the Player making
          it:
          (1) knew that the transfer was valid;
          (2) knew that the transfer was unauthorized; and
          (3) realized that e was making the transfer.

      (f) In particular, a Player who makes a valid but unauthorized
          transfer of Property as the result of an accident or mistake
          does not commit Embezzlement.

Rule 2006/0 (Power=1)
Looting Auctions

      As soon as possible after a player becomes a Dissolute, the
      Notary shall initiate an Auction for the privilege of Looting
      the Corpse of the Dissolute.  Once a Looting Auction begins, the
      Notary may not transfer property on behalf of the Dissolute
      until either the Auction ends without any winning bids or the
      winning bidder defaults on eir bid or loses eir privilege to
      Loot the Corpse of that Dissolute.

      Looting Auctions shall follow the default procedure for Auctions
      with the following modifications:

      (1) The Auctioneer shall be the Notary.
      (2) The Auction Currency shall be Indulgences.
      (3) The Starting Price shall be the number of Blots the
          Dissolute had when e became a Dissolute, or one Indulgence
          if the Dissolute was Immaculate.
      (4) The Auction shall be for a temporary privilege, not for an
          item, and so no debt of items to the winning Bidder when eir
          bill is paid shall be incurred.

      If there are no winning bids for the privilege of Looting the
      Corpse of that Dissolute, the Notary must, as soon as possible
      after the end of the Looting Auction, transfer all the
      Dissolute's property to the Bank.

      When the winning bidder pays eir bill from the Looting Auction,
      e gains the privilege of Looting the Corpse of that Dissolute; e
      becomes a Limited Executor of the Dissolute, with the authority
      to transfer property from the Dissolute to emself.  One week
      after e gains this privilege, e loses it, and ceases to be a
      Limited Executor of the Dissolute.  If the Dissolute still has
      property after the winning bidder loses this privilege, the
      Notary must transfer the Dissolute's remaining property to the
      Bank as soon as possible afterward.

Currencies
  This Category includes Rules concerning Currencies in general.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1467/7 (Power=1)
Definition of a Currency

      A Currency is a category of entities established by the Rules.
      Each instance of a Currency is a Property. Instances of a given
      Currency are fungible. The size of a single instance, or
      "unit", of a given Currency is its Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ).
      Individual units of a Currency cannot be divided; therefore,
      the final result of all computations involving numbers of units
      of Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest integral
      multiple of its MUQ.

      Unless otherwise specified, the MUQ of a Currency is one (1).

      Since units of Currency are fungible, it is not necessary for
      the Recordkeepor of a Currency to track the individual

Mintors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publicly announce when
      this happens.

      All Players have Mint Authority.

Rule 1722/2 (Power=1)
Creation of New Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority publicly posts a message stating that e is doing so,
      provided that also e states in that message the values of all
      properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The Mintor of
      a Currency created in this way is the entity which created it,
      any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.  If the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the Executor
      of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first consent to
      being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is created.

      A Currency is destroyed when the Mintor of that Currency
      publicly states that e is doing so, unless this destruction
      would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

         Cabinet members.

      The tax may include exemptions on a fixed amount of the holdings
      of every taxable entity, provided that:

         (i) All Players are exempt identical amounts,

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Units of Currency

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that

      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

Rule 1598/12 (Power=1)
Property Transfers

      (a) A Notice of Transfer is a message which sets forth the
          intent to transfer one or more Properties from one entity
          (the "transferor") to some other entity (the "transferee").

      (b) A valid Notice of Transfer must additionally:
          (1) specify one or more Properties all of which are owned by
              the transferor; and
          (2) be sent by the Executor of the transferor, or by a
              Limited Executor of the transferor with the authority to
              execute transfers on behalf of that entity with respect
              to all of the Properties involved.

      (c) A transfer of a Property occurs only when its Recordkeepor
          receives a valid Notice of Transfer.

      (d) The effect of a transfer of Properties is to cause the
          transferor to cease to possess the Properties transferred,
          and simultaneously to cause the transferee to possess them.

      (e) The Recordkeepor of a Property shall maintain a record of
          all transfers of that Property. E shall retain a record of
          each Notice of Transfer which e receives (whether valid or
          not) involving that Property. E shall retain this record of
          each Notice of Transfer for at least four weeks after its
          receipt.

      (f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with
          the purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee
          associated with performing an action, but the debt does not
          exist, or the action is not successfully performed, then the
          transferor may publicly demand the return of the Property.
          The effect of such a demand is to cause the transferee to
          incur a debt to the transferor for the Property transferred.

[In CFJ 1302, judged TRUE on 26 June 2001, the Judge agreed with the
 caller's argument that "a 'conditionally expressed Notice of
 Transfer' (that is, a message which appears to be a Notice of
 Transfer but with a condition attached), where a reasonable person
 would conclude that the sender of the purported Notice of Transfer
 did not possess, at the time e sent the purported Notice of Transfer,
 immediate knowledge as to whether the condition was true, does not
 express an 'intent to transfer one or more Properties' and as such is
 not a Notice of Transfer.  Rather, such a message expresses an intent
 to achieve a certain state of affairs which may or may not include a
 transfer, and as such fails to set forth the requisite intent
 required by Rule 1598."]

Rule 1596/6 (Power=1)
Debt

      (a) A "debt" is an obligation arising under the Rules for one
          entity (the "debtor") to make a transfer of one or more
          Properties to some other entity (the "creditor").

      (b) No debt shall be enforceable unless a notice sufficient to
          inform the debtor of the debt has been sent to the debtor.
          If a Rule requires that a public notice of a debt be posted,
          the debt is not enforceable until and unless that notice is
          posted.

      (c) A debt is satisfied when the debtor has transferred (or is
          deemed to have transferred) all the Properties named to the
          creditor (either as a single transfer or as the aggregate of
          multiple transfers).

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a
          notice to the debtor that e is forgiving the debt.
          Forgiveness may be for the entire debt or for any part
          thereof.  The effect forgiving a debt is as if the debtor
          had made a payment on the debt for the portion forgiven,
          except that no transfer of property takes place thereby.

      (e) An entity which receives Property as the result of an
          unauthorized transfer incurs a debt for the transferred
          Property to the entity that made the transfer.

Rule 1599/7 (Power=1)
Overdue Debts

      The Executor of the creditor of any unsatisfied debt may, at any
      time, demand the debtor to satisfy that debt, provided e has not
      already done so.  E does so by sending a message to the debtor
      setting forth the demand.  The debtor shall have seven days to
      satisfy the debt from the time the demand is sent, except that
      if the debtor's Executor is on Hold at the time the demand is
      sent, the debtor shall instead have seven days from when the
      debtor's Executor comes off Hold to satisfy the debt.  Time
      during which a debt is disputed is not counted for any purpose
      of this Rule.

      A debt not satisfied within the time allowed by this Rule
      becomes delinquent when that time elapses.  It ceases to be
      delinquent when it is satisfied.

      Any Player who is either:
        (a) the Executor of an entity which owes a delinquent debt, or
        (b) a Limited Executor of an entity which has no Executor and
            which owes a delinquent debt, where:
          (1) that Player has the authority to execute a transfer for
              that entity which would satisfy the delinquent debt, and
          (2) that entity possesses sufficient Property such that the
              delinquent debt can be satisfied;
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness when
      that debt first becomes delinquent, and commits it again every
      seven days thereafter for as long as the debt remains
      delinquent.  This Infraction may be reported by the creditor of
      the delinquent debt.

Rule 1853/8 (Power=1)
Levying Taxes

      Taxes may be levied only by an Officer explicitly permitted by

      An Officer levies a tax by announcing that e does so, and
      specifying:

        (1) The Currency being taxed.
        (2) The percentage of the tax.
        (3) Any exemptions applying to the tax.
        (4) The Rule authorizing em to levy the tax.

      Upon such an announcement, each taxable entity becomes liable to
      the Bank for a debt equal to the specified percentage of eir
      taxable holdings of that Currency at the time of the
      announcement.  As soon as possible after this happens, the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publish a report listing
      each entity's holdings of that Currency as of the time of the
      announcement.

      All entities are taxable, except for:

        (a) the Bank
        (b) all Rebellious Players who were Rebellious at the time the
            intent to levy was published
        (c) entities explicitly specified by the Rule authorizing the
            levy as tax-exempt for that levy

      All Currency holdings are taxable, except for holdings
      explicitly specified by the Rule authorizing the levy as
      tax-exempt for that levy.

      The percentage of the tax may not exceed 50%, unless the Rule
      authorizing the levy explicitly permits it to do so.

Rule 1661/9 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage. This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      Stems from the Bank to specific Players, only as specified in
      this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by paying out Stems to one or
      more Players, with a total of not more than one-half the Basic
      Officer Salary.  The Players to receive the award must not have
      received a Patronage award within the preceding four weeks, and
      the Speaker must provide a reason along with the Notice of
      Transfer. All such Patronage Awards in a single Week must be
      posted in a single message.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Rule 1887/14 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Auctions

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the Auctioneer shall select a rules-defined Auction
      Procedure and publicly announce eir selection. If e does not
      specify which procedure is used, the Default Auction Procedure
      shall be used.

      The details specified herein are for the Default Auction
      Procedure.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is responsible for collecting
          bids and announcing the result of the Auction. Unless
          otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Auctioneer.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. On
          Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. The Rule requiring a particular
          Auction must specify the currency to be used, or the
          Auction cannot take place.

      (d) Number of Lots: Each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical lots of identical items, which must all be owned
          by the same entity. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of lots up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is published, together with the
          identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction Currency, the number
          of items, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      (f) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting
          Bid is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (g) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction.  A Bid is a public message, announcing
          that the sender is bidding in that particular Auction, and
          the amount of eir Bid.  A Bid is only valid if it satisfies
          the following conditions:
          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, or
              after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the Auction
              Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (h) Canceling Bids: A Bid may be cancelled by its Bidder by
          publicly posting such, clearly identifying the Bid to be
          cancelled, while the Auction is in progress.

      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have
          passed without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid
          (at the time the Bid is made) having been made. The Auction
          shall end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has
          not ended earlier.

      (j) Winning Bids: When the Auction ends, the winning Bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid Bids in that auction (or
          all valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled Bids). Ties shall be broken in favor of earlier-
          submitted bids.

          The Final Auction Price is:
          (1) The amount of the Nth highest Bid, if there were N or
              more valid uncancelled Bids in the auction;
          (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
              uncancelled Bids.

          As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the
          Auctioneer shall announce the winning Bids and issue to each
          winning Bidder a separate bill for each of eir winning Bids.

      Unless specified otherwise, the owner of the Auctioned items
      shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to the
      winning Bidder when the bill for that lot is paid.

Rule 1966/0 (Power=1)
Bonds

      Bonds are Property.  Each Bond, in addition to being a Property,
      has the following characteristics:
      (a) an issuer (which must be a Player or an entity with an
          Executor);
      (b) a face value, expressed as the positive multiple of the MUQ
          of some Currency; and
      (c) a maturity date.

      A species of Bond consists of all Bonds with the same issuer,
      face value and maturity date.  All Bonds of a given species are
      fungible.  In any transaction involving Bonds, it is sufficient
      to identify the Bonds involved by species.

      The Recordkeeper of Bonds shall be the Usuror.

      A Bond is mature on and after its maturity date, and is immature
      prior to that date.  If the maturity date of a Bond is specified
      only as a date, it shall be presumed to mature at midnight UTC
      of that day (the beginning of that day).

Rule 1967/0 (Power=1)
Creation of Bonds

      New Bonds are created when an entity with Bond Issuance
      Authority sends a message to the Usuror stating that e is
      creating one or more new Bonds, provided that that message sets
      forth the face value and maturity date of each Bond to be
      created, and by paying the applicable Fee (if any) for creating
      those Bonds.  The newly created Bonds are possessed by the
      entity sending the message.  The issuer of the newly created
      Bonds is the entity sending the message.

      The Fee for creating Bonds shall be equal to the Basic Fee for
      issuing Bonds.  However, the Fee shall only be required for the
      first Bond of a given species created in the same message; there
      is no additional fee for additional Bonds of the same species
      created in the same message.  Furthermore, the Bank need never
      pay a Fee to create Bonds.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which imposes further restrictions
      on the ability of an entity to create new Bonds.

      The Bank, each Player, each Contest, and each Group all have
      Bond Issuance Authority.

Rule 1969/0 (Power=1)
Redemption of Bonds

      Any entity which possesses an unredeemed, mature Bond may redeem
      it by transferring the Bond to its Issuer, expressing in eir
      Notice of Transfer the purpose of redeeming the Bond.

      When the issuer of a Bond receives an unredeemed, mature Bond
      from another entity where the transfer was executed for the
      purpose of redemption, the Bond in question is thereby redeemed,
      and the issuer incurs a debt to the transferor of that Bond for
      the face value of the bond.

      If the issuer of a Bond receives an unredeemed, immature Bond
      from another entity where the transfer was executed for the
      purpose of redemption, the issuer incurs a debt to the
      transferor for that Bond; but if the Bond in question matures
      while still in the possession of the issuer, this debt is
      cancelled and the issuer incurs a debt to the transferor of that
      Bond for the face value of the Bond, as if the transfer had been
      made at the time the Bond matured.

      Once redeemed, a Bond may not be further transferred.

Rule 1971/0 (Power=1)
Bank Issuance of Bonds

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may issue Bonds with two Supporters.
      The number and species of Bonds to be issued must be set forth
      at the time the Treasuror seeks Support for the action.  The
      Bank may not otherwise issue Bonds except through the mechanism
      set forth in this paragraph.

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may Auction Bonds Without Three
      Objections.  Each Auction of Bank Bonds shall consist of some
      number of a single species of Bond.  The species of Bond, the
      number of Bonds of that species, the Auction Currency, and the
      Minimum Bid of each Auction shall be determined by the Treasuror
      as part of the message indicating eir intent to hold a Bank Bond
      Auction.  The Auctioneer of all Bank Bond Auctions shall be the
      Treasuror.

      The Bank is not required to actually possess the Bonds it
      intends to Auction at the time the intent to conduct an Auction
      is announced or at the time the Auction begins.  However, if the
      Bank, by virtue of not having sufficient quantity of some
      species of Bond, is unable to satisfy a debt arising from a Bond
      Auction within seven days of when the Auction ends, the Player
      who was Treasuror at the time the Auction began commits the
      offense of Selling the Blue Sky, a Class 6 Crime.

      the time the Bond was transferred.

      Authority, if that credit is greater than zero.

      The sale of a Bond is permitted only if one of the following is
      the case:
         * it is issued by the Bank.
         * it is issued by a player and would not cause the issuer's
           credit to exceed the Player Credit Limit in the currency in
           question as set forth in the Usuror's Budget.
         * it is issued by a non-Player entity other than the Bank and

      If the Executor of the issuer of a Bond used to commit Bond
      Fraud is not the Player who was charged with Bond Fraud, and
      said Executor knew that the Bond in question would be used for
      such a purpose, e commits the Class 4 Crime of Conspiracy to

      Voting Entitlements are a Bank Currency. The Recordkeepor of
      Voting Entitlements is the Assessor. The MUQ of Voting
      Entitlements is 0.001.

Rule 1946/4 (Power=1)
Distribution of Voting Entitlements

      The Ideal Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (IVECL) is equal
      to the number of registered Players.

      The Actual Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (AVECL) is the
      total number of Voting Entitlements owned by entities other
      than the Bank, augmented by the total number of Voting
      Entitlements owned by the Bank which have been auctioned off to
      Winning Bidders in prior Voting Entitlement Auctions but not
      yet paid for.

      The Voting Entitlement Surplus is the difference between the
      IVECL and the AVECL; if the AVECL is greater than the IVECL,
      the Voting Entitlement Surplus is zero.

      Whenever it occurs that the Voting Entitlement Surplus is
      positive and no Auction of Voting Entitlements is already in
      progress, the Assessor shall auction off the surplus Voting
      Entitlements. The items to be auctioned are lots of 0.1 VEs; the
      number of items is equal to the Voting Entitlement Surplus
      multiplied by 10, rounded down to the nearest integer.  The
      Auctioneer shall be the Assessor, and the Auction shall be
      conducted in Stems. Only Politicians may bid.

Rule 1929/4 (Power=1)
Points

      A Player's Score is a measure of that Player's unloserliness,
      measured in Points. The Score of each Player is at all times an
      integer. A Player who has not been Awarded or Penalized since
      the last Win has a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first such notification for that specific
            event

      Having a Score of 100 Points or more is a Win Condition. If at
      any time a Player Wins the Game, all Player's Scores shall
      instantly be set to zero.

Rule 1435/15 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Bank Currency. The Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ)
      of Indulgences is 0.001.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald.

      A Blot is a stain on a Player's record, recorded by the Herald.

      Whenever the Rules state that a Player gains or is assessed some
      number of Blots, and specify a method of reporting that gain or
      assessment to the Herald, then, as soon as possible after
      receiving such a notification, the Herald shall record an
      increase of that amount (or, if the affected Player is Unready,
      of one half (rounded to the nearest integer) of that amount) in
      the number of Blots staining the affected Player.

      Blots are expunged from a Player's record when:
      (1) an entity transfers to the Bank some number of Indulgences,
          specifying in the Notice of Transfer that the transfer is
          for the purpose of expunging the Blots of some Player; a
          number of Blots equal to the number of Indulgences
          transferred are expunged from the Player specified, or all
          of that Player's Blots if more Indulgences are transferred
          than that Player has (and the excess indulgences returned
          to the transferor); or
      (2) the Rules otherwise establish some method by which Blots
          are to be expunged, provided that such method must include
          a requirement of notice to the Herald of the expungement
          and such notice is actually sent to the Herald.

      A player with zero Blots staining eir record is said to be
      Immaculate.

      Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.

Rule 1712/12 (Power=1)
Distribution of Indulgences

      The Ideal Indulgence Circulation Level (IICL) is the number of
      registered Players, plus the total number of Blots held by
      Players.

      The Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) is the total
      number of Indulgences owned by entities other than the Bank,
      augmented by the total number of Indulgences owned by the Bank
      which have been auctioned off to Winning Bidders in prior
      Indulgence Auctions but not yet paid for.  The Monthly Bank
      Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of Indulgences transferred
      from other entities to the Bank during a given Nomic Month, less
      the number of Indulgences transferred from the Bank to other
      entities during that same Nomic Month.

      As soon as possible after the start of each month, the Herald
      shall calculate the Indulgence Differential, which is equal to
      the IICL minus the AICL, rounded down to the nearest integer.
      To calculate the Indulgence Differential, the Herald shall
      determine the number of Blots and the number of Indulgences
      owned as published in the most recent Herald's Report; other
      values in the formula shall be determined as of the time of the
      calculation. If the Herald makes an error in determining the
      number of Indulgences to be Auctioned, in good faith, that
      number shall be allowed to stand.

      If the Indulgence Differential is greater than zero, then the
      Herald shall, as soon as possible after the start of that month,
      auction a number of Indulgences equal to the Indulgence
      Differential; if the Indulgence Differential is not greater than
      zero, the Herald shall auction a whole number of Indulgences
      equal to or less than one half the MBIG for the preceeding
      month, with a minimum of 0 Indulgences.

      In an Indulgence Auction held in accordance with this rule, the
      items to be auctioned are individual Indulgences, and thus the
      number of items is equal to the number of Indulgences to be
      Auctioned. In addition, the Auctioneer shall be the Herald, and
      the Auction shall be conducted in Stems with only Acolytes being
      allowed to bid.

Rule 1714/7 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      A Player is Lawless if more than 20 Blots stain eir record.

      Any Player may at any time publicly allege that another Player
      is Lawless.  If the allegation is incorrect, the Player who made
      the allegation commits the Class 15 Crime of Persecution.
      Otherwise, the following events occur in order:

        (i)  if the Lawless Player is the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
             immediately becomes Speaker, and the Lawless Player
             ceases to be Speaker;

       (ii)  the Lawless Player is removed from any Offices e holds;
             and

      (iii)  the Lawless Player is deregistered.

      If a Player is deregistered according to the provisions of this
      Rule, e may not register again until a month has passed from eir
      deregistration.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered.

[CFJ 1059: Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
 Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit declaration that
 a particular Player is Lawless.]

Rule 1747/4 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Fugitives from
      Justice that have been deregistered for Lawlessness.  The Clerk
      may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic month, and
      may not Pardon the same person twice in a given term of Office
      (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon that person).
      The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Fugitive from Justice by
      publicly announcing e is doing so. Then the following events
      shall occur:

         i) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the Blots
            staining the Fugitive's record as required to reduce the
            number of Blots to one less than the threshold for
            Lawlessness and notify the Herald of this action.

        ii) After the above step has been completed, the Fugitive may
            reregister as a Player.

       iii) The Pardoned Player shall then publish a Formal Apology
            for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to
            ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        iv) For three months after being Pardoned, the Pardoned Player
            may only use Indulgences to expunge Blots from eir record
            and may not transfer any Indulgences for any other
            purpose.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      or when a deregistered Player may reregister.

Rule 1439/8 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four, unless the violated Rule explicitly defines
      or forbids a Blot penalty in the case of a CFJ.  The penalty
      shall be as defined in the Rule, if the Rule defines it; no Blot
      penalty shall be imposed if the Rule forbids it.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall notify the
      Herald of the Blot assessment.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall expunge the Blots that were given due
      to the initial Judgement of the CFJ and notify the Herald of
      this action.

Fugitives from Justice

      When a Player is deregistered from the game while not

      shall continue to keep a record of the number Blots staining
      each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Blots staining each Fugitive of Justice, rounding
      down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have eir number of
      Blots reduced to less than one by this method.

Rule 1647/7 (Power=1)
The Speaker-Elect

      There exists the Office of Speaker-Elect, whose responsibility
      it is to be the Speaker's successor.

      Whenever the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be
      Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker can never hold the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar cannot Nominate for the
      Office of Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect has no Electee, because of the
      Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker (or for any other reason), the
      Office is filled according to the Order of Succession, as
      defined by other Rules.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

      Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker remains Speaker only until there is an Electee
      to the Office of Speaker-Elect, at which point, a Speaker
      Transition occurs.

Rule 402/9 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition commences,
      the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy shall publish a Notice of
      Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the Transition
      and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect at the time
      the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under

      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the

Rule 1595/0 (Power=1)
Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

Rule 1594/1 (Power=1)
Violation of SLCs

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of one Blot, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

Rule 1457/11 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

Rule 1590/2 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      SLC between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

[CFJ 860: It is sufficient for the Rules to name an Officer as
 Maintainer of an SLC.]

Rule 766/15 (Power=1)
Groups

      A Group is an Organization with an associated SLC called its
      Ordinances. The Administrator for each Group is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor, the Executor is its Vizier, and the set of
      Players within the Jurisdiction of its SLC is its Membership.

      A Group's Membership may contain any Player who is not a Member
      of any other Group. Initially, the Group's Membership must
      contain at least three Foundors. The Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group;
      if either ceases to be a Member of the Group, it dissolves.

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

      A Group's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as follows:

        (a) A Group containing fewer than three members: zero;
        (b) A Group containing at least three members: the number of
            Players divided by the number of Groups with at least
            three members, rounded down.

[CFJ 816: There may exist more than one Group.]

Regulations and Membership of Contests

      No Player within Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is
      bound to obey any Regulation or combination of Regulations that
      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may publicly resign at any time,
      at which time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

Rule 1990/0 (Power=1)
Points Contests

      A Contest may be a Points Contest if its ACO specifically states
      that it is a Points Contest.  A Player may not be the
      Contestsmaster of more than one Points Contest in a single Nomic
      month.

      PWIN is the number of points required for a Player to achieve a
      win condition, as defined elsewhere in the Rules.  PPP (Points
      Per Player) is PWIN divided by twenty.

      Once during each month that starts while the Contest exists, a
      Points Contest's Contestmaster may post a single valid Notice of
      Award to the Public Forum, listing any number of the Contest's
      Contestants, and a listing a positive number of Points to be
      awarded to each Contestant on the list.  Different Contestants
      may be awarded different numbers of points in the same listing.
      The posting must obey all regulations for such posting contained
      in the Contest's SLC to be valid.

      The total Points listed to be awarded to all Contestants in each
      such monthly Notice may not exceed PPP times the number of
      Players who were Contestants of the Contest at any time in the
      14 days prior to the Notice.  If more points than this are
      listed the Notice is invalid.

      The total number of Points that a single Player may receive from
      all Points Contests in a single month may not exceed PWIN
      divided by five.  If a Points Contest Notice would bring a
      Player's total to more points than this than the Notice is
      invalid for that Player only.

      The posting of such a Notice of Award, if valid, is an event
      Awarding the listed Points to the listed Players.

Rule 1993/0 (Power=2)
The Land of Arcadia

      Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the
      Map).  The Map is a record kept by the Office of the Mapkeepor.

      The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units
      of Land, or simply Land.  Each Unit of Land is a unique instance
      of nonfungible Property specified by a pair of integers known as
      its Latitude and Longitude.

      Every unique pair of integers within the limits defined in the
      Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
      Land.  No other Units of Land may exist.  Units of Land may only
      be created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
      Longitude defined in the Rules.

      All values for Latitude must lie between -25 and +25, inclusive.
      All values for Longitude must lie between -25 and +25,
      inclusive.

      The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units
      of Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.

Rule 1994/0 (Power=2)
Ownership of Land

      Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
      changed belongs to an entity known as the Land Bureau (the
      Bureau).

      Land belonging to the Bureau is called Unclaimed Land.  Land
      belonging to the Bank is called Public Land.  Land belonging to
      any other entity is called Private Land.  A Unit of Land for
      which a debt exists is considered to be In Escrow.

      The Mapkeepor is the Executor of the Land Bureau.  The Mapkeepor
      is also a Limited Executor of the Bank, with the authority to
      satisfy debts of Land owed by the Bank to its creditors, and the
      authority to demand the payment of Land owed to the Bank by its
      debtors.

      The transfer of Unclaimed or Public Land to any entity must be
      specifically permitted by the Rules, or be performed by the
      explicit action of an instrument of Power 2 or greater, to be an
      authorized Transfer.

      Private Land may be transferred from its owner to any other
      entity by the owner's Executor.  Any other transfer of Private
      Land must be performed by the explicit Action of an instrument
      of Power 2 or greater to be an authorized transfer.

      Subtypes.  The Land Type or Subtype of a Unit may only be
      changed as specifically permitted by the Rules, or by an
      instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      The phrase "Units of X", where X is a Land Type (or Subtype)
      defined by the Rules, shall be considered a synonym for "Units
      of Land that have Land Type (or Subtype) X".

      When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
      permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
      defined by the Rules, it shall be considered to have the Land
      Type of Aether.  Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of
      Aether may not be transferred from the Bureau, or owned by any
      entity other than the Bureau.  If Private or Public Land becomes
      Aether it shall be transferred to the Bureau as soon as
      possible.

      When existent Land has not had its Subtype changed as explicitly
      permitted by the Rules, or has a Subtype that is not currently
      defined by the Rules as permissible for its Land Type, it shall

      The Penguin Distance between two given Units of Land is the
      minimum number of Single Waddles required to Travel from one of
      the given Units to the other given Unit, where one Single Waddle
      is the Penguin Distance required to Travel from one Unit of Land
      to an Adjacent Unit of Land.

      Of a Land Unit:
         (1) the Land Unit with the same Longitude and a Latitude
             greater by 1 is its Northern Neighbor.
         (2) the Land Unit with the same Longitude and a Latitude less

Rule 2000/0 (Power=1)
Rule Location

      The Rule Mapping is a Rules-defined calculation that maps
      a single integer (a Rule Number as defined elsewhere in the
      Rules) onto a single Latitude, Longitude pair within the limits
      of Latitude and Longitude on the Map of Arcadia.

      The Rule Mapping must be such that no two possible Rule Numbers
      between 101 and the Total Land Area of Arcadia are mapped to the
      same Latitude, Longitude pair.

      For any existent Rule, the Latitude and Longitude pair resulting
      from a Rule Mapping of the Rule's Number is the Rule's Location.
      A Rule's Location only changes if its Rule Number changes or if
      the Rule Mapping contained in this Rule changes.

      The Rule Mapping is defined by the following procedure:
        1.  The number 100 is subtracted from the Rule Number to
            calculate the number of Vulture Steps in the Rule Number's
            Vulture Journey.
        2.  The Latitude and Longitude of the Mapping shall be that of
            the Land Unit Visited when the final Vulture Step of the
            Rule Number's Vulture Journey is taken, where each Vulture
            Step in the Journey is taken as follows:

              (a) If no Vulture Steps have yet been taken in the
                  Journey, by visiting the Land Unit with Latitude 0,
                  Longitude 0; otherwise,
              (b) From the Land Unit most recently visited in the
                  specific Vulture Journey:
                  (i) If neither its Northern, nor Western, nor
                      Southern, nor Eastern Neighbor has been visited

Rule 2001/0 (Power=1)
This Landscape, This Ruleset

      Upon the adoption of this Rule, if a number which maps onto
      the Latitude, Longitude pair of an existent Unit of Land using
      the Rule Mapping, is not an existent Rule Number, the Unit's
      Land Type shall be changed to Aether.

      Otherwise, the Land Type of the Unit of Land at the Latitude,
      Longitude representing each Rule Number's Location:

        (i) shall be changed to Land Type Wilderness if the Rule has a
            Power greater than or equal to 1, but less than 2.

       (ii) shall be changed to Land Type Farmland if the Rule has
            a Power greater than or equal to 2, but less than 3.

      (iii) shall be changed to Land Type Urbana if the Rule has
            a Power of 3 or more.

      If a Rule Change enacts a new Rule, repeals an existing Rule, or
      changes the Power of a Rule, the Land Type at the Rule's
      Location shall be changed as above.  Land Types may still be
      changed by other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2003/1 (Power=1)
Moving in Arcadia

      Every week, each Player may expend up to 10 Movement Units to
      move about in the Land of Arcadia.  Movement Units are not
      transferrable, and do not persist from one week to the next.

      A player makes a Move by notifying the Mapkeepor of the location
      (the Destination) into which e is attempting to move.  If the
      Player has enough Movement Units left this week, and the Move is
      valid, the Player's Location is changed to the Destination.  So
      long as e does not spend more than eir allotted number of
      Movement Units, a Player may move as many times as e wishes in a
      single week.

      The Mapkeepor's Report shall list, for each Player:
        * the Player's location at the beginning of the last week
        * the Player's location at the beginning of the current week

      Players may expend:
        * 10 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Mountains.
        *  5 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Hills.
        *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Forest or Desert.
        *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness with no Subtype.
        *  2 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Farmland.
        *  1 Movement Unit to move into an adjacent unit of Type
           Urbana.

      A player may also expend 10 Movement Units to Explore, by
      notifying the Mapkeepor that e does so.  If a Player Explores,
      all units of Aether within a Penguin Distance of 2 from the
      Player's current location are assigned a new Land Type and
      possibly Subtype.  For each unit of Aether affected, there is a:
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Mountains;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Hills;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Forest;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Desert;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
       * 0.30 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.

      The random choice of new Land Type and Subtype is to be made by
      the Mapkeepor.  Affected units take on the new Land Type at the
      beginning of the next week, and all such changes shall be
      indicated in the Mapkeepor's Report for that week.

      Moves explicitly allowed by this Rule, including Exploring, are
      valid, unless made invalid by other Rules.  Unless explicity
      permitted by other Rules, all other Moves are invalid.

Rule 2004/0 (Power=1)
Land Auctions

      As soon as possible after the tenth day of each Month, the
      Mapkeepor shall, if the number of units of Land held by players
      is less than one half the total number of units of Land, auction
      a number of units of Land not to exceed 10.  The units of Land
      to be Auctioned are:
        * if there exist at least 10 Units of non-Aether Land in the
          possession of the Land Bureau: any 10 such Units of Land, to
          be chosen by the Mapkeepor;
        * if there exist fewer than 10 Units of non-Aether Land in the
          possession of the Land Bureau: all such Units.

      There shall be a separate Auction for each Unit of Land under
      consideration.  These Auctions shall be conducted concurrently.
      For each of these Auctions:
        * The item to be Auctioned is the piece of Land in question.
        * The Procedure to be used is the Vickrey Auction.
        * The Auctioneer shall be the Mapkeepor.
        * The Auction shall be conducted in Indulgences.

Rule 2005/0 (Power=1)
Tolls

      A Player who owns Land may impose a Toll on any (currently
      un-Tolled) piece of Land e owns.  To do so, e must pay a Fee of
      0.2 Indulgences and clearly and unambiguously identify the Unit
      of Land in question, as well as the amount of the Toll for that
      Unit of Land.

      A Toll is a number of VEs, Indulgences, or Papyri.  No Unit of
      Land may have a Toll in other currencies, or in more than one of
      these currencies.  No Toll shall be greater than 200 times the
      MUQ of the currency in which it is denominated.  If a Player
      (the Tollee) Moves into a Unit of Land which is at the time
      owned by another Player (the Toller), and for which there is at
      the time a Toll established, e (the Tollee) is said to be In
      Toll to the Unit of Land in question, for the amount of the Toll
      on that unit of land (at the time of the Move)

      The owner (Toller) of a Unit of Land may notify the Mapkeepor
      that e believes a Player has been In Toll to a Unit of Land
      owned by em; to do so, e submits a Notification of Toll, which
      must unambiguously describe the Unit of Land in question, the
      amount of the Toll, and the Player (alleged Tollee) in question.
      The alleged Move must have occurred within the past week.  A
      Player may submit only one such Notification for a given Unit of
      Land in a single week, and may not submit substantially the same
      Notification two weeks in a row.  Any Notification of Toll
      contrary to this Rule is invalid and shall be discarded.

      If, in the Mapkeepor's determination, the alleged Tollee was in
      fact, in the week before the Notification, In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, the Mapkeepor
      shall confirm the Toll by publicly informing the Tollee and the
      Toller.  The Tollee then incurs to the Toller a debt equal to
      the Toll specified in the Notification.  If, in the Mapkeepor's
      determination, the alleged Tollee was not In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, e shall deny
      the Notification by informing the Toller of eir determination.

      If the Mapkeepor fails to respond to a valid Notification of
      Toll, e commits the Class 2 Crime of Looking the Other Way.  If
      the Mapkeepor confirms a Notification of Toll when in fact the
      alleged Tollee was not In Toll to the specified Unit of Land for
      the specified amount, e (the Mapkeepor) commits the Class 3
      Crime of Conspiracy to Commit Highway Robbery.  If the Mapkeeper
      denies a Notification of Toll when in fact the alleged Tollee
      was In Toll to the specified Unit of Land for the specified
      amount, e (the Mapkeepor) commits the Class 3 Crime of Not
      Feeding the Toll Under the Bridge.

      A Player may remove a Toll from any Tolled Unit of Land e owns.
      If a Player loses possession of a Unit of Land, all Tolls
      imposed on that Unit by that Player are removed.

Rule 2007/0 (Power=1)
Developing Land

      A Player who owns a Unit of Land and is Located at that Unit of
      Land may change the Land Type and/or Subtype in the following
      manner:

      a) If the Unit of Land is of Type Wilderness, e may change that
         Unit of Land to Type Farmland by expending 5 Movement Points
         and paying a Fee of:

           i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Forest;

           ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Desert; or

           iii) 1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Mountain.

      b) If the Unit of Land is of Type Farmland, e may change that
         Unit of Land to Type Urbana by expending 5 Movement Points
         and paying a Fee of:

           i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit
                will have Subtype Road;

           ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit
                will have Subtype Aqueduct; or

           iii) if there are no Units of subtype City within a Penguin
                Distance of 3 from the Unit, The Unit is Connected to
                a Unit of Water by Aqueduct, and there are at least 8
                Units of Farmland within a Penguin Distance of 2 from
                the Unit, 1 BOS in Stems, in which case the Unit will
                have Subtype City. In this case the Player is required
                to give a unique name to the City.

      Units affected by this Rule take on the new Land Type at the
      beginning of the next week, and all such changes shall be
      indicated in the Mapkeepor's Report for that week.

Rule 2008/0 (Power=1)
Arcadian Cities

      A Unit of Land of Subtype City may be referred to as just a
      City, Arcadian City, or by its unique name, if any.

      The Unit of Land at (0,0) shall always remain a City. This city
      shall be named Tripolis, the Capital of Arcadia, and shall
      always be Public Land, owned by the Bank. This takes precedence
      over any Rule to the contrary.

      Any City other than Tripolis ceases to be a City and becomes a
      Unit of Land of Subtype Road whenever:

      a) It is not Connected to Water by Aqueduct; or

      b) There are less than 8 Units of Farmland within a Penguin
         Distance of 2 from the City.
