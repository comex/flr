Rule 101/7 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absence of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to initiate a formal process to
            resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable
            expectation that the controversy will thereby be resolved.
            Every person has the right to cause formal reconsideration
            of any judicial determination that e should be punished.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player has the right to deregister rather than
            continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825 (called 7 November 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if
no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1848 (called 21 December 2007): The game must operate according
to the rules that prevail at the time, and not attempt to incorporate
any retroactive changes made in the future.]

[CFJ 1709 (called 26 July 2007): The rules are binding on all those
who play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they
have the rule-defined status of "player".]

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1488 (called 11 February 2004): Engineering a situation in which
other players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself
a violation of that rule.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): The requirement that "no
interpretation of Agoran law may abridge ... a person's defined
rights" means that it must be feasible, given the practical limits of
Agoran evidence-gathering, to remain reasonably sure that a person's
defined rights are not being limited.]

[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): The right of participation in the
fora is the right to participate in them for their intended purposes,
and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner
and type of participation.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): An obligation on a player to not
publish statements that e believes are true would conflict with the
right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1753 (called 28 September 2007): The right to cease playing
applies only to those who have the rule-defined status of "player",
not to those who play the game in the broader sense without having
that official status.]

Rule 2125/2 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if:

      a) It is IMPOSSIBLE.

      b) It is ILLEGAL.

      c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.

      d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action MAY NOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.

      e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for which
         some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such an action
         CANNOT modify that information except as allowed by the
         rules.

      f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated, and
         has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.

Rule 1586/3 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      Two Rule-defined entities CANNOT have the same name or nickname.

      If the Rules defining an entity are repealed or amended such
      that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
      properties cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they still
      define that entity but with different properties, then that
      entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever extent
      is possible under the new definitions.

[CFJ 1807 (called 25 November 2007): Rule-defined entities include
pending timed events, which can therefore occur under modified rules
even if the events that originally triggered them would not trigger
them under the new rules.]

Rule 1688/4 (Power=3)
Power

      The power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
      An instrument is an entity with positive power.

      The power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the rules.  All entities have power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      A rule that secures a change (hereafter the securing rule)
      thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that change except as
      allowed by an instrument with power greater than or equal to the
      change's power threshold.  This threshold defaults to the
      securing rule's power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      rule.

Rule 2140/0 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can

      (a) cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

      (b) adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than
          its own.

      (c) modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with
          power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
          an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
          operation.

Rule 2186/0 (Power=2)
Victory

      Winning Conditions and Losing Conditions exist only as defined
      by rules.  Defining these things is secured.

      A win announcement is a correct announcement explicitly labeled
      as a win announcement.

      When one or more persons satisfy at least one Winning Condition
      and do not satisfy any Losing Conditions, all such persons win
      the game.  This is the only way to win the game, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Each Winning Condition should (if needed) specify a cleanup
      procedure to prevent an arbitrary number of wins arising from
      essentially the same conditions.  When one or more persons win
      the game, for each Winning Condition satisfied by at least one
      of those persons, its cleanup procedure occurs.

Rule 2110/5 (Power=3)
Win by Paradox

      A tortoise is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of
      a rule-defined action (actual or hypothetical, but not arising
      from that case itself, and not occurring after the initiation of
      that case) for which the question of veracity is UNDECIDABLE.

      Upon a win announcement that a tortoise has continuously been a
      tortoise for no greater than four and no less than two weeks,
      the initiator satisfies the Winning Condition of Paradox.

      Cleanup procedure:  Each winner satisfying this Winning
      Condition SHALL, as soon as possible, make a reasonable attempt
      to resolve the paradox.  The same person can not satisfy this
      Winning Condition again for the same tortoise or for any other
      tortoise that was linked to it in assignment.

Rule 2199/1 (Power=2)
Ribbons

      Ribbons are a class of fixed assets.  Changes to Ribbon holdings
      are secured.  Ownership of Ribbons is restricted to players.

      Each Ribbon has exactly one color.  Colors with different names
      are distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of
      Ribbon is a currency.

      The Tailor is a low-priority office, and the recordkeepor of
      Ribbons.

      Ribbons are gained as follows, unless the player already
      possesses the color of Ribbon to be gained:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted and changes at least
           one rule with Power >= 3, its proposer gains a Red Ribbon.

      (+O) When an interested proposal is adopted by voting with no
           valid votes AGAINST, its proposer gains an Orange Ribbon.

      (+G) At the end of each month, each player who held at least one
           office continuously during that month gains a Green Ribbon,
           unless e failed to perform an official duty within a time
           limit during that month.

      (+C) When a player deputises for an office, e gains a Cyan
           Ribbon.

      (+B) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question
           other than a question on sentencing, e gains a Blue Ribbon,
           unless e violated a requirement to submit that judgement
           within a time limit.

      (+K) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question on
           sentencing, e gains a Black Ribbon, unless e violated a
           requirement to submit that judgement within a time limit.

      (+W) When a first-class person becomes a player for the first
           time, e gains a White Ribbon.  When a first-class person
           has been a player continuously for at least three months,
           was never a player before that period, and names another
           first-class player as eir mentor (and has not named a
           mentor in this fashion before), that player gains a White
           Ribbon.

      (+M) When, during Agora's birthday, a player publicly
           acknowledges the occasion, e gains a Magenta Ribbon.

      (+U) When a player is awarded the Patent Title Champion, e gains
           an Ultraviolet Ribbon.

      (+V) When a player is awarded a Patent Title, e gains a Violet
           Ribbon, unless e gains a different Ribbon for the award.

      (+I) When a player is awarded a degree, e gains an Indigo
           Ribbon.

      (+Y) At the end of each month, for each contest that awarded
           points to at least three different contestants during that
           month, the contestmaster gains a Yellow Ribbon.

      If this rule mentions at least six different specific colors for
      Ribbons, then a player CAN destroy one Ribbon of each such color
      in eir possession to satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Renaissance.

[Cross-references (6 February 2008): the Tailor's duties are:
  * recordkeepor of ribbons (rule 2199)]

[Note (30 August 2007): here is a set of colors with convenient
abbreviating letters, suggested for future inventions of new types of
ribbon: Amber, Blue, Cyan, Denim, Emerald, Fern, Green, Heliotrope,
Indigo, Jade, blacK, Lime, Magenta, iNfrared, Orange, Pink,
aQuamarine, Red, Silver, Turquoise, Ultraviolet, Violet, White, flaX,

Rule 2177/5 (Power=2)
The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding sixty days.  The collection of
      Senators is the Senate.  The Registrar's report includes a list
      of all Senators.

      A Senator CAN call an Emergency Session with 2 Senate
      supporters, provided no other emergency session existed at any
      time in the preceding 48 hours.  An emergency session lasts for
      21 days after being called.  The Assessor's report includes the
      most recent date on which an emergency session was called.

      The roll call of an emergency session is the set of senators at
      the time the emergency session was called.  During emergency
      session, the previous definition of senator does not apply;
      instead, any player who is a member of the roll call is a
      senator.  The Assessor's report includes the roll call of the
      most recent emergency session.

      During emergency session, any Senator CAN declare a filibuster
      on a proposal in its voting period, with 2 supporting Senators,
      provided no filibuster has been declared on that proposal in the
      past.  Any Senator CAN end a filibuster on a proposal with 4
      supporting Senators.

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      When an emergency session begins, all non-Senators' postures
      become supine, and non-Senators CANNOT flip their posture while
      the session lasts.

Rule 2141/1 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern
      the game generally.  A rule's content takes the form of
      a text, and is unlimited in scope.  In particular, a rule
      may define in-game entities and regulate their behaviour,
      make instantaneous changes to the state of in-game entities,
      prescribe or proscribe certain player behaviour, modify the
      rules or the application thereof, or do any of these things
      in a conditional manner.

      Every rule has power between one and four inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor shall assign
      a title to it by announcement as soon as possible.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.

[CFJ 1498 (called 12 April 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a
name for the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the
uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.]

Rule 217/6 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

[CFJ 1139: Interpretations [judgements at the time of CFJ 1139] need
not necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
Justices given in past CFJs.]

Rule 1482/2 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule
      to stipulate any other means of determining precedence
      between Rules of unequal Power.  This applies to changes by
      the enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit
      such a change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1103 (called 18 August 1998): In the case of conflict between
Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer to the
lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes precedence
over Rule 1482.]

[CFJ 858 (called 15 February 1996): If a low-Power [low-MI at the time
of Judgement of CFJ 858] Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule
of higher Power to mean something other than its ordinary English
meaning, that may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does
must be decided on a case-by-case basis.]

Rule 1030/6 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower ID number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence-determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Rule 105/3 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The ID number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument; any
          attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes
      that change to be void and without effect.  A variation in
      whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of an existing
      rule does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this
      rule, but any other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 1499 (called 20 April 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 1 April 2007): If a
low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is different
from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal itself.]

[CFJ 708 (called October 1994): An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is
not a legal Rule Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
separate attempts at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

Rule 1681/12 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      a) The type of change.

      b) The date on which the change took effect.

      c) The mechanism that specified the change.

      d) If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
         proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Rule 869/25 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A person CAN register, unless prevented by the rules, by
      announcing that e registers, wishes to register, requests
      registration, or requests permission to register.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement.  E CANNOT register
      within thirty days after doing so.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

      last changed.

      A player CAN flip eir activity by announcement.  "To go on hold"
      is to become Inactive; "to come off hold" is to become Active.

      A player CAN flip another player's activity to Inactive without
      objection.

      A player who has been continuously Inactive for at least three
      months CAN be deregistered by any other player without

      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each forum with non-Foreign
      publicity, sufficient instructions for players to receive
      messages there.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A person "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.  Any
      action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message.

[CFJs 1451-1452 (called 6 March 2003): A message that is split into
multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct the
single message.]

[CFJ 752 (called 13 March 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813 (called 22 October 1995): A Player need not prove that e can
receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831 (called 10 November 1995): The Date: header of a message is
not necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 866 (called 8 April 1996): A message is "received" when the
message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1314 (called 15 August 2001): If a message sent to a public forum
is rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
sent via a public forum.]

[CFJ 1905 (called 7 February 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message
has not been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to
receive messages via the forum receive it.]

[CFJ 1888 (called 31 January 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion
Forum, or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not
qualify as sending it to all players.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1784 (called 5 November 2007): An undescriptive or misleading
subject line does not deprive the message body of effect.]

[CFJ 1880 (called 22 January 2008): A phrase that would, in the
message body, cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not
have such an effect if it appears in the subject line.]

[CFJ 1761 (called 30 September 2007): Publishing part of a message is
a different action from publishing the whole message.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1719 (called 12 August 2007): A player can, if e intends, have
public messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that
allows all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific
approval.]

[CFJs 1833-1834 (called 18 December 2007): A player can, by
contractual arrangement, grant another player the capacity to act by
announcement on eir behalf.]

[CFJ 1893 (called 3 February 2008): A non-consensual non-contractual
arrangement cannot grant a player the capacity to act by announcement
on behalf of another.]

[CFJ 1336 (called 13 December 2001): A public statement that one
wishes to perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
constitute an announcement that performs that action.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

[CFJ 1584 (called 24 February 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 August 2007):
Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of instances
of "I do X".]

[CFJ 1774 (called 1 November 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where
X is something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
abusive.  The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
successful.]

[CFJ 1775 (called 1 November 2007): If an announcement of the form "I
do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do
X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have
the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
M.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): An appropriate announcement will
accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
impossible.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): A message-based action cannot be
retroactive.]

Rule 2170/2 (Power=3)
Who Am I?

      Rules regarding persons pertain to those persons directly, not
      to rule-defined avatars or other entities representing those
      persons within Agora.

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement intended to mislead
      others as to the identity of its publisher.

      A public message's claim as to who published it is
      self-ratifying, unless the claim is self-contradictory, or a
      challenge of identity pertaining to the claimed publisher has
      been issued within one month before its publication.

      The Executor of a public message is the first-class person who
      sends it, or who most directly and immediately causes it to be
      sent.  The executor of an action performed by announcement is
      the executor of the announcement.

Rule 754/7 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning, as do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly
          defined by the rules.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 1439 (called 20 February 2003): A difference in language
qualifies as a difference in dialect; it is possible to take game
actions by messages in languages other than English.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): If a message is in a language other
than English, and its intended audience does not understand the
language, this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message
ineffective.]

[CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.]

[CFJ 1861 (called 8 January 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer to
em.]

[CFJ 1782 (called 4 November 2007): Referring to a player by the name
of an office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a
person, if there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.]

[CFJ 1840 (called 20 December 2007): A proper noun that has not been
explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is not
implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.]

[CFJ 1580 (called 12 January 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a
message, other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers,
can render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding
step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): HTML encoding (including
numerical character entity encoding) does not render a message
ineffective for unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a
header.]

[CFJ 1741 (called 11 September 2007): An email message does not need
the RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be
interpreted in the MIME way.]

[CFJ 1536 (called 13 March 2005): The phrase "AOL!" is not a
sufficiently clear synonym for "Me too!".]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): A contract can redefine a
rule-defined term in its own way, and the contract's definition will
then apply in situations governed by the contract.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a
meaning by custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does
not unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
meaning.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Mentioning a URI, without
surrounding text stating its significance, does not incorporate
anything identified by that URI into the message that mentions the
URI.]

[CFJ 1831 (called 10 December 2007): Character sequences within a URI
by default have no significance other than their functional role as
part of the URI.]

Rule 2152/4 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
      a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
      precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
      persons in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
      the specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      4. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      5. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rule in question.

      6. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

Rule 1023/23 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrases "in a timely fashion" and "as soon as possible"
          mean "within seven days".

      (b) The term "paragraph" means a subset of text determined as
          follows:

          (1) Each bulleted or enumerated (hereafter simply
              "bulleted") section is a unit of text.

          (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

          (3) Each unit of a document has a level as follows.  All
              unbulleted units have level 1.  Each bulleted unit has
              level n+2, where n is the number of bulleted units it is
              nested inside.

          (4) A barrier between two units is a unit appearing between
              those units which has level no greater than that of the
              unit appearing first.

          (5) The units of a document form an ordered tree, with the
              hierarchy determined as follows.  The root is an empty
              unit with level zero, which nominally appears at the
              beginning of the document.  One unit is a descendant of
              another unit if it appears after the latter, has
              strictly greater level, and is not separated from the
              latter by a barrier.  The tree's ordering follows the
              order of the units in the document.

          (6) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
              determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
              entirety of that quotation.

          (7) A "paragraph" identified by an ordinal n is determined
              by the nth unbulleted unit and its descendants.

          (8) A "paragraph" identified by enumerated section labels is
              determined by the sub-tree arrived at by traversal from
              the root, using the specified series of labels.

      (c) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

Rule 2161/2 (Power=2)
ID Numbers

      If a rule defines a type of entity as having ID numbers, then:

      (a) Whenever an instance of that type does not have an ID
          number, the player held responsible by that rule SHALL
          assign an ID number to it by announcement as soon as
          possible.

      (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
          number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
          digits) distinct from any ID number, and greater than any
          orderly ID number, previously assigned to an entity of that
          type.  The player SHALL select the smallest number possible,
          unless e reasonably believes that selecting any smaller
          number might be invalid or confusing.

      (c) Each ID number is either orderly (default) or chaotic.  Upon
          a judicial finding that the assignment of an ID number was
          ILLEGAL, the ID number becomes chaotic.

      (d) Once assigned, an ID number cannot be changed.

      (e) If an office is responsible for assigning ID numbers, then
          that officer's report includes the greatest orderly ID
          number, and a list of all chaotic ID numbers, previously
          assigned to the type of entity.

Rule 2146/1 (Power=2)
Indices

      Indices are elements of the extended real numbers, which is a
      total order consisting of the real numbers plus a minimum
      element, called negative infinity, and a maximum element, called
      positive infinity or unanimity.

      The ratio of a positive index to zero is positive infinity.  The
      ratio of a negative index to zero is negative infinity.  The
      ratio of zero to any index is zero.

Rule 2162/1 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes the value of each instance of
         that switch whose value is not its default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

Rule 2150/3 (Power=3)
Personhood

      A person is an entity that has the general capacity to be the
      subject of rights and obligations under the rules.  An entity is
      a person if and only if it is defined to be so by rules with
      power 2 or greater.

      Any biological organism that is capable of communicating by
      email in English is a person.

      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.

      The basis of a first-class person is the singleton set
      consisting of that person.

[CFJ 1700 (called 10 July 2007): The requirement of capability to

Rule 2166/5 (Power=2)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely
      because its backing document defines its existence.

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
      an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a class
      of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred
      to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
      by an entity outside that class (except for the Lost and Found
      Department, in which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it
      without objection).

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
      such by its backing document.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
      portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying.

      An asset whose backing document is not a rule generally CAN be
      created by its recordkeepor by announcement, subject to
      modification by its backing document.  To "gain" an asset is to
      have it created in one's possession; to "award" an asset to an
      entity is to create it in that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
      announcement, and an asset owned by the Lost and Found
      Department generally CAN be destroyed by its recordkeepor by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing document.
      To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
      possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
      from that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be transferred by its owner to another
      entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document.  Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): The self-ratifying asset
report is the complete list of ownerships of assets of that class; a
partial list does not self-ratify.]

[CFJ 1850 (called 22 December 2007): The general ability of the
recordkeepor to create assets does not include an ability to determine
who possesses them when created, so they are necessarily owned by the
Lost and Found Department [at the time of CFJ 1850, the Bank] upon
creation.]

[CFJ 1910 (called 10 March 2008): When an existing entity is defined
as an asset, the change of its owner from "undefined" to the Lost and
Found Department [Bank at the time of CFJ 1910] counts as a transfer,
and fails if the Lost and Found Department is outside of the class of
objects that can own the entity.]

Rule 2181/5 (Power=1)
The Accountor

      The Accountor is a low-priority office; its holder is
      responsible for keeping track of miscellaneous assets.

      The Accountor's report includes a list of all classes of assets,
      and their backing documents and recordkeepors.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets whose
      backing document does not specify a different recordkeepor.

[Cross-references (28 May 2008): the Accountor's duties are:
  * report classes of assets (rule 2181)

Rule 1728/19 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      A player CAN perform an action dependently (a dependent action)
      if and only if the Rules explicitly authorize the player to
      perform the action by one of the following methods:

      - Without N Objections, where N is a nonnegative integer;
      - With N Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer; or
      - With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1,
        with a minimum of 1.0.

      The phrase "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1
      Objection"; the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter"; the phrase "With Agoran Consent" is synonymous with
      "With 1.0 Agoran Consent".

      A player authorized to perform a dependent action (the
      initiator) CAN publicly announce eir intent to do so,
      unambiguously describing both the action and the method,
      including the required value for N.  A player (the performer)
      CAN perform a previously unambiguously described dependent
      action by announcement, if and only if all of the following are
      true:

      (a) the time elapsed since the announcement of intent is no more
          than fourteen days, and (if the action is to be performed
          Without N Objections or With N Agoran Consent) at least four
          days;

      (b) either the performer was the initiator, or the action
          depends on support and the performer has supported the
          action and the rule allowing the action to be performed
          dependently does not explicitly prohibit supporters from
          performing it, or the initiator was authorized to perform
          the action by virtue of holding a rules-defined position and
          the performer is the holder of that position when e attempts
          to perform the action; and

      (c) At the time the action is attempted, Agora is Satisfied with
          the announced intent, as described elsewhere.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): The method of dependent action need
not be described exactly: an approximate but inexact description
suffices, as does the rule-defined term.]

[CFJ 1802 (called 19 November 2007): The phrase "by Agoran Support" is
not an unambiguous description of a method of dependent action.]

Rule 2124/7 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of a dependent action is a first-class player who
      has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
      announcement of intent to perform the action.  An Objector to a
      dependent action is a first-class player (or other person
      explicitly allowed to object to that action by the rule allowing
      that action to be performed dependently) who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent
      to perform the action.

      The Executor of such an announcement of intent CANNOT support
      nor object to it.  A rule authorizing the performance of a
      dependent action may further restrict the eligibility of players
      to support or object to that specific action.

      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      if and only if:

      (1) the action is to be performed Without N Objections, and it
          has fewer than N objectors;

      (2) the action is to be performed With N supporters, and it has
          N or more supporters; or

      (3) the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, and the
          ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the
          action has at least one supporter and no objectors.

Rule 1769/7 (Power=3)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event (including the
      time limit to perform an action) upon the time of another event,
      and

      a) that other event occurs during a Holiday, then the time at
         which that Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose
         of determining the time of the future event.

      b) the future event would occur during a Holiday, then the
         future event occurs 72 hours after the end of that Holiday
         instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require events to be
      performed before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The registration of a player is an
event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1480 (called 5 January 2004): An automatic event specified to
occur at regular calendar intervals, for example quarterly, happens at
its specified time even if that is during a holiday.]

Offices
      A category concerning administrative positions held by persons

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/25 (Power=2)
Offices

      A role is an office if and only if it is so defined by the
      rules.  Each office at any time either is vacant (default) or is
      filled (held) by exactly one player.  The holder of an office is
      an officer, and may be referred to by the name of the office.

      An office is imposed if it is so described by the rule defining
      it; otherwise, it is elected.

      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant.  As soon as possible after an
      elected office becomes (or is created) vacant, the IADoP SHALL
      make at least one nomination for the office; this requirement is
      waived if another player so makes a nomination.

[CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning
of the term "office", in the sense meant by rule 754, but rather
references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
offices as thus defined.]

[CFJ 1702 (called 12 July 2007): A requirement to submit something to
an officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is
vacant at the time.]

Rule 2154/13 (Power=2)
Replacing Officers

      Any player CAN by announcement nominate one or more active
      players to be candidate(s) for an elected Office. This begins a
      nomination period for that office, during which other candidates
      may be so nominated.  The nomination period lasts for four days.
      Once a nomination period begins, a new one CANNOT begin for the
      same office until the nomination or resulting election is resolved.
      A consenting candidate is a player who was nominated during
      the first half of the nominating period and did not refuse,
      or who was nominated during the second half and accepted.

      As soon as possible after the nomination period ends, then: (a) if
      there is only one consenting candidate, the IADoP SHALL install em
      in the Office by announcement; (b) if there are two or more
      consenting candidates, then the IADoP SHALL initiate an Agoran
      decision to determine the new officeholder; this process is known
      as an election.

      In an election, the valid options are the consenting nominees
      (hereafter the candidates), quorum is the lesser of three and
      the number of active players (other rules on quorum
      notwithstanding), the eligible voters are the active players.
      If a player refuses eir nomination during the election, e
      ceases to be a valid option.

      In the notice resolving the decision, the IADoP will select a
      candidate that received at least as many votes as any other
      candidate (if any); this candidate thereby becomes the
      officeholder.

      Stability is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP,
      with values Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN
      flip an office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual
      office becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      The IADoP SHALL make at least one attempt to install a player
      into an office, and SHALL make the change if possible, under
      the following circumstances:

        a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start
           of that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
           previous quarter.  This requirement is waived if another
           player makes such a change during the current quarter.

        b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
           after the office ceases to have an active holder.  This
           requirement is waived if the office comes to have an
           active holder during that week (month).

      public document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel
      any messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or
      overlooked, or change the legality of any attempted action.

      Ratifying a public document is secured.

Rule 2202/0 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      An official document is a public document purported to be part
      (possibly all) of an official report; this part is the
      document's scope.  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify an
      official document, specifying its scope.  The date of this
      ratification and the scope of the ratified document become part
      of the official report in question, until the same scope is
      ratified at a later date.

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): Ratification of an official
document affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to
be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list
of players.]

Rule 2201/0 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly and
      publicly challenged during that period via one of the following
      methods, explaining the scope and nature of the perceived error:

      a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
         interpretation.

      b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
         publisher of the original document SHALL respond to a claim
         of error as soon as possible, either publishing a revision or
         denying the claim.  If e denies the claim, then the original
         document is ratified one week after the denial, unless it is
         challenged again (subject to the same requirements) during
         that period.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying
document [at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran
decision] must explicitly identify the document, either individually
or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some
aspect of it.]

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): A challenge to any part of
a self-ratifying document prevents ratification of all parts of it.]

Rule 2160/3 (Power=1)
Deputisation

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if:

      (a) the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
          office is vacant, would so require if the office were
          filled); and

      (b) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired; and

      (c) the deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier
          that e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes
          of the particular action; and

      (d) it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

[CFJ 1776 (called 1 November 2007): A requirement to perform an
action, for the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication
from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules.]

Agoran Decisions

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:

          (a) Initiation of the decision.

Rule 107/9 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) A clear indication of the options available.

      (d) The identity of the vote collector.

      (e) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
          parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
      voting period for a decision cannot be shorter than seven days.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
the information required in the notice need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1743 (called 18 September 2007): If the notice does not mention
voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the
rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
describes the class of eligible voters.]

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): Information that is explicitly
presented in the notice takes precedence over any information that
would be implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate
and the implicit information would have been accurate.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 683/14 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision, and the submitter is an eligible voter at the
          time of submission.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

      Among the otherwise-valid votes on an Agoran decision, only the
      first N submitted by each entity are valid, where N is the
      entity's voting limit on that decision.  The voting limit of an
      entity that is not an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is
      zero.  The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
      decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

[CFJs 1852-1853 (called 23 December 2007): Claiming to submit more
votes than ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the
making of a false statement.]

Rule 2127/2 (Power=1)
Conditional Votes

      A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be submitted
      conditionally, and the truth or falsity of the condition and
      thus the selected option will be determined as it exists at the
      end of the voting period.

      The option selected shall be considered to be clearly identified
      if and only if the truth or falsity of the specified
      condition(s) can be reasonably determined, without circularity
      or paradox, from information published within the voting period.

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites; PRESENT is its own
      opposite.

Extending the voting period

      period for that decision will immediately be doubled, provided
      this has not already happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHOULD issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible.

Rule 208/7 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the option selected by Agora.  If
      it was required to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it as soon
      as possible after the end of the voting period.  To be valid,
      this announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

[CFJ 1711 (called 1 August 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via a References: header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does not qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1810 (called 28 November 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via an approximate date header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1822 (called 4 December 2007): If a purported resolution notice
includes invalid votes in its tally of votes, this makes the notice
invalid.]

Standard Classes of Agoran Decisions

      than or equal to 2 is democratic.  Any other Agoran decision
      with an adoption index is ordinary by default.

      If an Agoran decision has an adoption index, then the following
      are essential parameters:

      a) Its adoption index.
      b) Whether it is ordinary or democratic.

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the available
      options are FOR, AGAINST, and PRESENT.

Rule 955/13 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      The outcome of an Agoran decision is determined as follows.

      (a) If there is more than one available option, and the number
          of distinct voters who submitted valid ballots is less than
          quorum, then the outcome is FAILED QUORUM, regardless of the
          remainder of this rule.  Otherwise, the decision achieved
          quorum.

      (b) If the decision is ordinary or democratic, then the voting
          index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of
          AGAINST.  If the voting index is greater than 1, and greater
          than or equal to the decision's adoption index, then the
          outcome is ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is

Rule 2034/4 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
      existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is
      wholly without effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      This does not prevent amendment of the rules governing the
      validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
      changed in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
      does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

      A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.

======================================================================
Proposals
      A category concerning the primary and plenipotent system by
      which changes are made to the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/13 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  That player is its
      author (syn. proposer).  The author of a proposal may remove it
      from the Pool by announcement.

      A person is a co-author of a proposal if and only if e is
      distinct from its author, and unambiguously identified by its
      author as being its co-author at the time of submission.

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9.  It may be set by the proposer at the time of
      submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the adoption index is the adoption index of
      the proposal, and the vote collector is the Assessor.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule which would permit a
      proposal to take effect.

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1717 (called 8 August 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient
to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): "AGAINT" is a variant spelling of
"AGAINST", not a customary synonym for "FOR", despite its former
private usage with the latter meaning.]

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

[CFJ 1781 (called 4 November 2007): Proposal distribution is not
governed by this rule, so for the promotor to distribute a proposal
that is not in the proposal pool is not a violation of this rule.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): It is possible for a proposal to
have retroactive effect.]

Rule 2153/1 (Power=1)
Interest Index

      The interest index of a proposal is an integer from 0 to 3.  It
      CAN be set by the proposer at the time of submission, or
      otherwise defaults to 1.  A proposal's interest index SHOULD be
      proportional to its complexity.

      "Disinterested" is a synonym for "interest index 0".  A proposal
      SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects are limited
      to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

Rule 1607/18 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal Pool at
      any time.  The Promotor's weekly duties include the distribution
      of each proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool since the
      beginning of that week.

      The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

      For an Agoran decision of whether to adopt a proposal, the
      following are essential parameters:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its interest index.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.

[CFJ 1546 (called 14 April 2005), CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a
proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted
proposal if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of
the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal distribution
of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor creates a new
proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a
proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential
differences), then the author of the new proposal is the author of the
proposal on which it is based.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor accidentally
creates a new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is
seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
proposal has no author.]

[Cross-references (2 August 2007): the Promotor's duties are:
  * not distribute proposals during holiday (rule 1769)
  * distribute proposals (rule 1607)
  * manage ID numbers of distributed proposals (rule 1607)
  * report proposal pool (rule 1607)]

Rule 2156/8 (Power=2)
Voting on Ordinary Decisions

      Caste is a player switch, tracked by the Grand Poobah, with the
      following values and their numeric equivalents:

        Alpha   - 8
        Beta    - 5
        Gamma   - 3
        Delta   - 2
        Epsilon - 1 (default for active first-class players and
        provinces)
        Savage  - 0 (default for all other players)

      Changes to caste are secured.

      The eligible voters on an ordinary decision are those entities
      that were active players at the start of its voting period.  The
      voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary decision is eir
      caste at the start of its voting period, or half that (rounded
      up) if the voter was in the chokey at that time.

Rule 2211/2 (Power=2)
The Grand Poobah

      The Grand Poobah is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of castes.

      The Grand Poobah CAN generally flip a Player's caste by
      announcement, but SHALL only do so as explicitly described by
      the Rules.  If the result of a claim of error or court case
      finds that e has flipped a Player's caste illegally (e.g. not
      as specified by the Rules), e SHALL flip the caste to the
      appropriate correct value as soon as possible.

      If a player believes that a caste switch has been flipped
      illegally, e CAN switch it back with three Support, provided e
      has first raised a claim of error or court case concerning the
      matter.  However e (and supporters) SHALL defer to the courts
      and the Grand Poobah's ability to correct the issue, unless
      they present a good and pressing reason not to do so; abuse of
      this ability should not be taken lightly by the courts.

      At the beginning of each month, each Alpha's caste is flipped to
      eir default value.  As soon as possible after the beginning of
      each month, the Grand Poobah SHALL do the following, in order,
      at each step choosing (if possible) a player who has not yet
      been chosen during the current procedure:

        1) Promotions.  At each step, the Grand Poobah SHALL choose a
           player whose caste is as high as possible without equalling
           or exceeding the new caste:

           a) Flip a player's caste to Alpha
           b) Flip a player's caste to Beta
           c) Flip a player's caste to Gamma
           d) Flip a player's caste to Delta

        2) Demotions.  Each step is repeated as many times as needed.

           b->c) While there are more than two Betas,
                   flip a Beta's caste to Gamma
           c->d) While there are more than three Gammas,
                   flip a Gamma's caste to Delta
           d->e) While there are more than four Deltas,
                   flip a Delta's caste to Epsilon

      During the seven days immediately prior to the start of a month,
      the Speaker CAN publish an Honors List, indicating a list of
      players other than emself for promotion.  If such a list is
      published, the Grand Poobah SHALL, during the Promotions step
      above, make as many legal promotions from this list as possible
      before making any other promotions.

      the specified player satisfies the Winning Condition of Clout.

Rule 2126/56 (Power=2)
Notes

      Notes are a class of fixed assets.  Ownership of Notes is
      restricted to players.  Changes to Note holdings are secured.

      Each Note has exactly one pitch from the chromatic scale
      (ignoring octaves, and treating enharmonics as equivalent).
      Each pitch of Note is a currency.

      The Conductor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Notes.

      Key is a player switch, tracked by the Conductor, with values
      equal to the pitches that Notes can have, defaulting to C.  A
      player CAN change eir Key to any value by announcement, unless e
      has already done so during the current month.

      Notes are gained as follows, except that the pitch actually
      gained is as many semitones higher than the pitch listed below
      as the player's Key is higher than C at the time of the gain:

      (1) At the end of each week, for each player, let X be the
          number of eir interested proposals that were adopted during
          that week, and let Y be the number of eir interested quorate
          proposals that were rejected during that week with VI >=
          AI/2:

          (F)  If X > Y > 0, then e gains an F Note.
          (F#) If X > Y = 0, then e gains an F# Note.
          (G)  If X = Y > 0, then e gains a G Note.
          (Ab) If Y > X = 0, then e gains an Ab Note.
          (A)  If Y > X > 0, then e gains an A Note.

      (2) (E)  At the end of each week, each player who completed the
               non-empty set of weekly duties of at least one office
               during that week gains an E Note.

          (Eb) At the end of each month, each player who completed the
               non-empty set of monthly duties of at least one office
               during that month gains an Eb Note.

      (3) (D)  At the end of each week, each player who published at
               least one on-time judgement during that week gains a D
               Note.

      (4) (C)  At the end of each week, each player who gained at
               least one Point during that week gains a C Note.

          (C#) At the end of each week, each contestmaster who awarded
               at least one Point during that week gains a C# Note.

      (5) (B)  At the end of each week, each player who authored at
               least one proposal with an Interest Index of 2 that
               passed during that week gains a B note.

          (Bb) At the end of each week, each player who authored at
               least one proposal with an Interest Index of 3 that
               passed during that week gains a Bb note.

      Notes CAN be spent (destroyed) as follows:

      (1) A player CAN spend three Notes forming a major chord to
         increase another non-Alpha player's caste by 1 level.

      (2) A non-Alpha player CAN spend five Notes forming the start of
          a major scale to increase eir own caste by 1 level.

      (3) A player CAN spend three Notes forming a minor chord to
          decrease another non-Savage player's caste by 1 level.

      (4) A non-Savage player CAN spend five Notes forming the start of
          a minor scale to decrease eir own caste by 1 level.

      (5) A player CAN spend two Notes of the same pitch to make
          another player gain one Note of that pitch.

      (6) During Agora's Birthday, a player CAN spend Notes forming
          the melody "Happy Birthday" (GGAGCB GGAGDC GGGECBA FFECDC or
          a translation thereof) to satisfy the Winning Condition of
          Musicianship, unless another player has already done so
          during that Birthday.

      (7) A player CAN spend one Note to increase another player's
          voting limit on an ordinary proposal whose voting period is
          in progress by 1.

      (8) A player CAN spend two Notes to increase eir voting limit on
          an ordinary proposal whose voting period is in progress by
          1.

      (9) A player CAN spend three Notes to gain a Note whose pitch is
          as many semitones distant from one of the Notes spent as the
          distance between the other two Notes spent.

      The maximum FINE amount for each pitch of note is 2.

at the time of these CFJs] cannot be by a negative number.]

Rule 2019/18 (Power=2)
Prerogatives

      In a timely fashion before the beginning of each month, the
      Speaker SHALL assign each Player who bears the patent title
      Minister Without Portfolio a different Prerogative for the
      upcoming month by announcement.  If there are more members in
      one set than the other, then e SHALL choose which members of the
      larger set take part in the assignment.

      The following Prerogatives are defined:

      a) Default Officeholder.  The Default Officeholder CAN become
         holder of a vacant elected office by announcement, unless e
         is prevented from holding that office on an ongoing basis.

      b) Justiciar.  Once within three days after an appeal case comes
         to require a judge, the Justiciar CAN make that case either
         hot or cold by announcement.  If the Justiciar has not done
         so, then the Clerk of the Courts SHALL NOT assign a panel to
         that case during this period.  If the Justiciar has done so,
         then the Clerk of the Courts SHALL assign a panel including
         (if the case is hot) or excluding (if it is cold) the
         Justiciar, if possible.

      c) Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto an ordinary
         decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
         its Adoption Index by 1.

      d) Wielder of Rubberstamp.  The Wielder of Rubberstamp CAN
         rubberstamp an ordinary decision in its voting period by
         announcement; this decreases its quorum to 3, rules to the
         contrary notwithstanding.

      e) Wielder of Extra Votes.  The Wielder of Extra Votes at the
         start of an ordinary proposal's voting period has a voting
         limit on that proposal of 1.4 times what it would be
         otherwise (rounded using the same method as the weekly update
         of EVLOD), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

Adjudication
      A category concerning the judicial system by which matters of
      controversy are resolved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/11 (Power=2)
Judicial Cases Generally

      A judicial case, also known as a call for judgement (CFJ), is a
      procedure to settle a matter of controversy.

      Each judicial case has exactly one subclass, with particular
      features as defined by other rules.  Subclasses of judicial case
      exist only as defined by the rules.  Defining a subclass of
      judicial case is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  A
      judicial case's subclass CAN be specified by its initiator, or
      otherwise defaults to inquiry.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office, responsible for
      managing judicial activity.  The CotC's report includes the
      status of all judicial cases that either require a judge or have
      at least one applicable judicial question that has no judgement.

      Judicial cases (other than appeal cases, which have historically
      been identified by reference to the prior case) have ID numbers,
      to be assigned by the Clerk of the Courts.

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[CFJ 1355 (called 28 April 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so
it is possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.]

[Cross-references (28 May 2008): the Clerk of the Courts' duties
are:
  * issue Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * not assign judges during holiday (rule 1769)
  * prefer judicial panels containing the Default Justice (rule 2019)
  * report open judicial cases (rule 991)
  * manage ID numbers of non-appeal judicial cases (rule 991)
  * refuse excess CFJ (rule 2175)
  * assign judge to judicial case (rule 1868)

Rule 2175/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      If a judicial case has not had any judge assigned to it, then:

      a) Its initiator CAN retract it by announcement, thus causing it
         to cease to be a judicial case.

      b) If its initiator previously initiated five or more cases
         during the same Agoran week as that case, then it is an
         excess case, and the Clerk of the Courts CAN refuse it by
         announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.

Rule 1868/12 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge.
      This is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.

      At any time, a judicial case either does not require a judge
      (default) or requires a judge.  This is not a persistent status,
      but is evaluated instantaneously.

      When a judicial case requires a judge and has no judge assigned,
      the CotC CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by
      announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as possible.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
      case are the active first-class players, subject to modification
      by other rules.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge
      does not inherently prevent an entity from continuing to be
      judge of a case to which e is already assigned.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is
      still the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from
      that case by announcement.

      Making an entity unqualified or poorly qualified to judge is
      secured, with a power threshold of 1.5.

      To recuse a judge from a case is to deassign em as its judge.
      Assigning a judge to a case implicitly recuses its existing
      judge, if any.  A recusal is "with cause" if and only if stated
      as such by the rules.

[CFJ 1186: The Clerk of the Courts is required by Rule 1868 to select
a Judge who is qualified ["eligible" at the time of CFJ 1186] at the
time that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
qualified at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced.]

Rule 1871/24 (Power=1.5)
The Standing Court

      Posture is a player switch, tracked by the Clerk of the Courts,
      with the following values:

      * Standing.  Standing players are generally qualified to judge.

      * Sitting.  Sitting players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        will generally become qualified when the CotC rotates the
        bench.

      * Leaning.  Leaning players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        are generally qualified to serve on appeal panels.

      * Supine (default).  Supine players are unqualified to judge.

      Changes to posture are secured.

      A player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value by
      announcement.

      When the CotC assigns a player as judge, that player becomes
      sitting.

      The CotC CAN rotate the bench (change all sitting players to
      standing) by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so unless there is a
      judicial case to which e is obliged to assign a judge, all
      entities qualified to be so assigned are poorly qualified, and e
      immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns a
      judge to that case.

      When the CotC recuses a non-supine player with cause, e SHALL
      flip that player's posture to supine by announcement in a timely
      fashion.

[CFJ 1765 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, this rule makes em capable of doing
so.]

[CFJ 1766 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, eir capability to do so exists as
long as the obligation does, and this obligation does not terminate
due to the time limit running out.]

        judge of any inquiry case.

      * Hugging.  Hugging players are unqualified to be assigned as
        judge of any criminal case, and poorly qualified to be
        assigned as judge of any equity case.

      * Hemming-and-Hawing (default).

Rule 2157/5 (Power=1.7)
Judicial Panels

      A judicial panel is a structure whereby a group of two or more
      persons (its members) act together for the purpose of judging
      judicial cases.  A judicial panel's membership cannot change,
      and if two panels have the same membership then they are the
      same panel.  Judicial panels exist implicitly, without any
      specific act of formation.

      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous Support of the panel's other members, or
      (unless the CotC is a member of the panel, the prior judge, or
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the prior case) with the
      Support of at least half the other members and the Support of
      the CotC.  The CotC SHOULD so Support a majority action if the
      panel has made a reasonable effort to achieve consensus.  By
      this mechanism a judicial panel can act, in situations where the
      rules state that an action is performed by sending a message.

      A judicial panel can incur obligations.  The members of a panel
      SHALL act collectively to ensure that the panel satisfies all of
      its obligations.

[CFJ 1746 (called 21 September 2007): A judicial panel is not a
person.]

Rule 2158/5 (Power=2)
Judicial Questions

      A judicial question is a question that arises within a judicial
      case.  Judicial questions arise only as defined by the rules.
      Defining a judicial question is secured, with a power threshold
      of 1.7.

      At any time, each judicial question is either inapplicable
      (default) or applicable.  This is not a persistent status, but
      is evaluated instantaneously.

      At any time, each judicial question is either open (default),
      suspended, or has exactly one judgement.  This is a persistent
      status that changes only according to the rules.  The possible
      types of judgement for a judicial question depend on the type of
      question.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, its case
      requires a judge.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as
      possible.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement
      to any judicial question.  A judgement is valid and/or
      appropriate only as defined by the rules.  Defining these things
      is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  If more than one
      judgement is valid and appropriate, then the choice between them
      is left to the judge's discretion.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its judge
      has violated a time limit to assign a judgement to it, the Clerk
      of the Courts SHALL recuse that judge with cause by announcement
      as soon as possible; however, this requirement is waived if the
      judge assigns a judgement to it first.

[CFJ 1804 (called 19 November 2007): A judge should give the judgement
that e believes is appropriate, and if e does so in good faith then e
can be EXCUSED if the judgement is later found to have been
inappropriate.]

[CFJ 1871 (called 15 January 2008): The appropriateness of a judgement
is determined solely by the facts of the case, and is independent of
the reasoning used by a judge to decide on the judgement.]

Rule 2164/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Self-Recusal and Case Transfer

      The judge of a judicial case CAN recuse emself from it at any
      time by announcement.  If e has been assigned to the case for at
      least four days, such a recusal is with cause.

      An entity (the transferee) CAN, with consent from the current
      judge of a judicial case (the transferor), assign emself as the
      new judge of that case, provided that e is qualified to be
      assigned as judge of that case, and e immediately (in the same
      announcement) assigns a judgement to a judicial question in that

Rule 591/26 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an inquiry case.
      An inquiry case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a
      particular statement.  An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any
      first-class person, by announcement which includes the statement
      to be inquired into.  (Including a yes/no question is equivalent
      to including a statement that the answer to that question is
      yes, and for such a case, YES and NO are synonymous with the
      judgements TRUE and FALSE respectively.)

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true, at the time the inquiry
        case was initiated

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement at
        the time the inquiry case was initiated is not relevant to the
        game

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
        UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose

      The judgement of the question in an inquiry case, and the
      reasoning by which it was reached, SHOULD guide future play
      (including future judgements), but do not directly affect the
      veracity of the statement.  The Rulekeepor is ENCOURAGED to
      annotate rules to draw attention to relevant inquiry case
      judgements.

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): A question cannot generally take
the place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.]

[CFJ 1903 (called 6 February 2008): The question-statement equivalence
established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the subject
of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public
knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine
it.]

[CFJ 1482 (called 10 February 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement
logically depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called
CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this
as a situation of insufficient information being available.]

[CFJ 1744 (called 18 September 2007): It is not the job of the judge
to hunt down or request the information that would be required to
render a substantive judgement.]

[CFJ 1771 (called 28 October 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around
the interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is entitled
to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
available.]

[CFJ 1732 (called 23 August 2007): If a particular player holds a
particular office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player
holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that
office.]

Rule 1504/28 (Power=1.7)
Criminal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as a criminal case.
      A criminal case's purpose is to determine the culpability of a
      particular person, known as the defendant, for an alleged breach
      of the rules, and to punish the guilty.  A criminal case CAN, with
      2 Support, be initiated by any first-class person who is a member
      of the basis of any player, by announcement which clearly specifies
      all of the following:

      a) The identity of the defendant.

      b) Exactly one rule allegedly breached by the defendant.

      c) A specific action (which may be a failure to perform another
         action) by which the defendant allegedly breached this rule.

      d) The messages (if any) in which the action occurred.

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      In the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL as soon as possible inform
      the defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument
      for eir guilt.  The pre-trial phase ends one week after the
      defendant has been so informed.  At any time during the
      pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN end the pre-trial phase by
      announcement.

      The initiator and each member of the defendant's basis are
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the case.  During the
      pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN disqualify one person from
      assignment as judge of the case, by announcement.  If e
      disqualifies the judge, then the judge is recused.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on culpability, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are:

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated

      * ALREADY TRIED, appropriate if judgement has already been
        reached in another criminal case with the same defendant, the
        same rule, and substantially the same alleged act

      * UNIMPUGNED, appropriate if the alleged act would not have
        violated the specified rule

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act

      * SLIPPERY, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine beyond a reasonable doubt
        whether or not the defendant performed the alleged act

      * UNAWARE, appropriate if the defendant reasonably believed that
        the alleged act did not violate the specified rule

      * EXCUSED, appropriate if the defendant could not reasonably
        avoid breaching the rules in a manner at least as serious as
        that alleged

      * GUILTY, appropriate if the defendant breached the specified
        rule via the specified act and none of the above judgements is
        appropriate

      A criminal case has a judicial question on sentencing, which is
      applicable if the question on culpability is applicable and has
      a judgement of GUILTY.  If a criminal case has an applicable
      question on sentencing which has a judgement, the defendant is
      hereafter known as the ninny, the judgement in the question on
      sentencing is known as the sentence, and the sentence is in
      effect.

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      active while all of the following are true, inactive otherwise:

      1) It is still in effect.

      2) At least one week has elapsed since it first took effect.

      3) Sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
         have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.
         (That is, if an active sentence is suspended and later
         reinstated or superseded by a similar sentence, then the
         defendant gets credit for time served prior to the
         suspension.)

      The CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.

      The valid sentences are:

      * DISCHARGE, appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances, if
        any available non-null punishment would be manifestly unjust.
        Has no effect.

      * APOLOGY with a set of up to ten words (the prescribed words),
        appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.  When in
        effect, the ninny SHALL as soon as possible publish a formal
        apology of at least 200 words, including all the prescribed
        words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
        for self-improvement.  The ninny is only obliged to publish
        one apology per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
        this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
        than once.

      * FINE with an amount of one currency, appropriate for rule
        breaches of small consequence.  An amount is only valid if the
        currency's backing document binds the ninny or the ninny has
        this amount of the currency, and the backing document specifies a
        maximum FINE amount, and the amount is no greater than the
        maximum.  When in effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours either
        destroy this amount of eir currency or transfer it to the Lost
        and Found Department.  The ninny is only obliged to perform one
        destruction or transfer per question on sentencing, even if
        sentences of this type are assigned more than once or go into
        effect more than once.

      * CHOKEY with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied
        by the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for rule breaches of
        intermediate severity.  While a sentence of this type is
        active, the ninny is in the chokey.  No entity is in the
        chokey except as required by this rule.

      * EXILE with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied by
        the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for severe rule breaches
        amounting to a breach of trust.  While a sentence of this type
        is active, the ninny is exiled.  No entity is exiled except as
        required by this rule.  If an exiled entity is ever a player,
        e is deregistered.  An exiled entity CANNOT register.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a criminal
      case within the past week CAN be initiated by the defendant by
      announcement.

expressed in the form "violating rule NNNN by XXX", the alleged act
for the purposes of the rules is only "XXX".]

eir action is legal when it is not.]

[CFJs 1808-1809 (called 28 November 2007): Sentencing a ninny to
"APOLOGY" without explicitly giving a set of prescribed words
constitutes sentencing the ninny to APOLOGY with the empty set of
prescribed words.]

[CFJ 1846 (called 20 December 2007): For the purposes of prescribed
words, words do not need to be a standard part of the language.]

Rule 2169/7 (Power=1.7)
Equity Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an equity case.
      An equity case's purpose is to correct a potential injustice in
      the operation of a particular contract.  An equity case CAN be
      initiated by any party to the contract, by announcement which
      clearly identifies the contract and a state of affairs whereby
      events have not proceeded as envisioned by the contract (such as,
      but not limited to, a party acting in contravention of eir
      contractual obligations).  This announcement SHALL also clearly
      identify the set of parties to the contract.

      The initiation of an equity case begins its pre-trial phase.  In
      the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL in a timely fashion inform
      all the contracting parties of the case and invite them to
      submit arguments regarding the equitability of the situation.
      The pre-trial phase ends one week after the parties have been so
      informed, or immediately when all parties have announced that
      they wish to terminate the pre-trial phase.

      The members of the bases of the parties to the contract are all
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the case.

      An equity case has a judicial question on equation, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are the possible agreements
      that the parties could make that would be governed by the rules.
      A judgement is appropriate if and only if it is a reasonably
      equitable resolution of the situation at hand with respect to
      the matters raised in the initiation of the case and by the
      parties in the course of the case.

     When an applicable question on equation in an equity case has a
     judgement, and has had that judgement continuously for the past
     week (or all parties to the contract have approved that
     judgement), the judgement becomes Enforceable as a set of
     regulated requirements imposed by this Rule.

     Every party to the contract SHALL act to ensure the terms of
     an enforceable equity judgement specific to that party are
     satisfied, though this requirement does not create the ability
     to perform regulated actions that the party CANNOT otherwise
     perform.

     If a party fails to act as specified, e is in violation of this
     Rule; in such a situation, the judge CAN act on the party's behalf
     to fulfill said obligations Without 3 Objections, or the party may
     be subjected to a criminal punishment other than DISCHARGE for
     violating this Rule, but not both.

     The judge CAN, Without Objection from the parties, nullify a
     specified term or terms of the judgement, thereby removing the
     requirement of parties to act as specified.

     An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in an equity
     case CAN be initiated by any party to the contract in question
     by announcement.  If the judgement is Enforceable when it is
     appealed, the Appeals Court SHOULD assume that the judgement was
     fundamentally fair when made, and SHALL restrict its appeals
     judgement to nullifying terms of the judgement which are no
     longer applicable due to changed circumstances.

[CFJ 1772 (called 28 October 2007): An equity case cannot be initiated
with the rules as the subject contract.]

Rule 911/21 (Power=1.7)
Appeal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an appeal case.
      An appeal case's purpose is to determine the appropriateness of
      a judgement that has been assigned to a judicial question, and
      make remedy if the judgement was poorly chosen.  The assignment
      of judgement being questioned (appealed against, or appealed) is
      referred to as the prior assignment; the word "prior" in this
      rule is used to refer to the circumstances of the prior
      assignment.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case within the past two weeks CAN be initiated by any player
      with 2 support.  However, rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      an appeal CANNOT be initiated concerning an assignment caused by
      a judgement in an appeal case, nor an assignment for which an
      appeal has already been initiated.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of three members, where each
      of the members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior
      case and none of the members is the prior judge.

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition, and their
      effects, are as follows:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question; the prior judgement is assigned to the
        prior question again

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity; the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement, or if the prior judge
        exhibited corruptive self-interest (material, with a specific
        and obvious impact on eir judgement and arguments, and not
        arising merely due to a difference of opinion or a wholly
        incidental material benefit common among many players); the
        judge of the prior case (if any) is recused, and the prior
        question is rendered open again
 
      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question; the replacement judgement
        is assigned to the prior question

      When an appeal case is initiated, the prior question is
      suspended, and remains so until the question on disposition in
      the appeal case is judged.

      A panel CAN publish a concurring opinion when judging AFFIRM,
      and SHALL do so if and only if the reasoning by which the prior
      judge reached eir judgement was incorrect in whole or part.
      Each concurring opinion SHALL explain the nature of the error(s)
      in the prior judge's reasoning.  Each concurring opinion has an
      error rating, an integer from 1 to 99; it CAN be specified by
      the panel when the concurring opinion is published, or else
      defaults to 50.

      In the week after the panel publishes a valid judgement, any
      panel member may publish a formal Dissenting Opinion with
      Support.  This Dissenting Opinion becomes a part of the record
      of the case, and SHOULD aid in interpreting the decision.

[CFJ 1597 (called 22 December 2006): It is possible to appeal a
judgement even if it is not certain that the judgement exists.]

[CFJ 1800 (called 18 November 2007): An announcement of the form "I
call for the appeal of <judgement>" has the effect of initiating the
Agoran decision on whether to approve appealing the cited judgement.]

Patent Titles and Degrees
      A category concerning titles of honor and dishonor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/27 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item given in recognition of a
      person's distinction.  The herald is a low-priority office; its
      holder is responsible for tracking patent titles.

      A Patent Title CAN only be awarded by a proposal, or by the
      announcement of a person specifically authorized by the Rules to
      make that award.  A person so authorized SHALL make the award as
      soon as possible as the conditions authorizing em to make the
      award are posted publicly, unless there is an open judicial
      question contesting the validity of the conditions.  Awarding or
      revoking a Patent Title by Proposal is a secured change.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person is said
      to Bear that Patent Title.  When a Patent Title is revoked from
      an entity, that entity ceases to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.  The Herald's report includes a
      list of each Patent Title that at least one entity Bears, with a
      list of which entities Bear it.

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

      When a patent title is used as a noun to refer to bearers of the
      patent title, it is assumed to refer only to persons who Bear
      that patent title unless context clearly indicates otherwise.

[CFJ 1525 (called 15 November 2004): If a patent title is defined by
the rules, and previously the rules defined a patent title with the
same spelling but a different award condition, the two are the same
patent title.]

[CFJ 1592 (called 1 December 2006): A patent title, once borne, is
borne until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent
title is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.]

[CFJ 1731 (called 23 August 2007): It is possible for an entity [a
person at the time of CFJ 1731] to bear more than one instance of a
patent title simultaneously.]

[CFJ 1591 (called 1 December 2006): Where a person bears the patent
title X, and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special
meaning, it is correct to say that that person "is an X".]

[Cross-references (9 February 2008): the Herald's duties are:
  * report Patent Titles (rule 649)
  * announce award or revocation of Patent Title (rule 649)
  * award patent title of Champion (rule 1922)
  * report the manner of wins (rule 1922)
  * report title dates for Ministers Without Portfolio (rule 402)]

Rule 1922/25 (Power=1)
Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for the Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as one, with two Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with three Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
           Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
           awarded by the IADoP to any player who has held a
           particular Office continuously for the specified duration.
           Each of these titles shall be awarded only once per player.

      (d)  Champion, to be awarded by the Herald to any person who
           wins the game.  The Herald's report includes how the player
           won.

      (e)  Minister Without Portfolio, to be awarded by the Herald to
           any player who wins the game and does not already bear the
           title.  If the number of persons bearing this title is
           greater than the number of Prerogatives defined by the
           rules, then this title is administratively revoked from
           all non-players; if it is still greater, then this title
           is administratively revoked from the Speaker.

      (f)  Left in a Huff, to be awarded by the Clerk of the Courts or
           the Registrar (whichever one gets around to it first) to
           any player who publishes a Cantus Cygneus.

      (g)  Elder Lurker, to be awarded to Persons who are true legends
           that were involved in Agora in its early days and now
           continue to grace us with their presence by lurking on the
           lists to occasionally add tid-bits of wisdom or insight to
           discussions.

[CFJ 1865 (called 14 January 2008): The Patent Title of Champion
CANNOT be awarded by announcement of the Herald to a person who has
not won the game.]

Rule 1367/11 (Power=1.5)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.

      A degree SHOULD be awarded ONLY IF its new bearer has published
      a suitable thesis with explicit intent to qualify for a degree
      (though not necessarily for the specific degree being awarded).
      A thesis is an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic or
      of nomic in general.  A thesis's suitability depends on its
      originality and quality, with regard to the rank of the degree
      to be awarded.

======================================================================
Contract Law
      A category concerning binding agreements that can be adjudicated
      within this nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/16 (Power=1.5)
Contracts

      Contracts are binding agreements governed by the rules.

      Each contract requires a certain number of parties (two if not
      otherwise specified by the rules).  Any agreement made by one or
      more persons, with the intention that it be binding on them and
      governed by the rules, becomes a contract when it comes to have
      at least the required number of parties, and terminates when it
      comes to have less than the required number of parties.

      Parties to a contract SHALL act in accordance with that
      contract.  This obligation is not impaired by contradiction
      between the contract and any other contract, or between the
      contract and the rules.

      As it is manifestly unjust to bring criminal punishment into a
      manner of equity, if a player is found GUILTY of violating this
      Rule by failing to act in accordance with a contract, the only
      appropriate sentence is DISCHARGE, unless said failure is with
      respect to a previously-imposed Equity judgement.

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement that is not binding
is thereby not a contract.]

[CFJ 1901 (called 4 February 2008): An agreement that is binding is
thereby a contract, even if it doesn't impose any obligations.]

[CFJ 1892 (called 2 February 2008): An agreement's text can disclaim
contract/binding status, thereby nullifying itself, by explicitly
describing itself as a non-contract or as non-binding.]

[CFJ 1872 (called 15 January 2008): Being a player is not a
prerequisite for becoming party to a contract.]

[CFJ 1796 (called 14 November 2007): If a person announces that e
agrees to be bound by a particular text as a contract, without saying
who this agreement is with, and the contract text does not regulate
who can become a party to it, then any person can become a party to
the contract by announcement.]

[CFJ 1455 (called 14 March 2003): A contract cannot cause an
otherwise-insignificant action by a non-party to constitute consent to
be bound by the contract.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): A contract is null and void if
the courts do not have sufficient evidence that a person's
contract-related rights (in rule 101) are not being infringed.  This
includes evidence that the party to the contract has reviewed the
rules and has direct prior knowledge of the fora.]

[CFJ 1686 (called 7 June 2007): A person who is not a party to an
agreement categorically cannot violate it.]

[CFJ 1752 (called 28 September 2007): Deregistration does not
implicitly cause the ex-player to leave a contract.]

[CFJ 1842 (called 20 December 2007): A contract may use retroactive
operations internally for the purposes of determining obligations of
the parties, but such legal fictions do not affect Agora as a whole.]

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): A contract cannot have
retroactive effect.]

[CFJ 1843 (called 20 December 2007): Becoming a party to a contract
cannot occur retroactively, for the purposes of determining
justiciability of the contract.]

[CFJ 1816 (called 2 December 2007): A contract is not generally able
to define terms used by the rules.]

[CFJ 1819 (called 3 December 2007): A contract is not able to create
new ways of winning the game.]

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): An authorisation granted by a
party in a contract takes precedence over a unilateral statement by
that party that purports to cancel that authorisation.]

Rule 2197/1 (Power=1.5)
Defining Contract Changes

      A Contract Change can be one or more of any of the following:

      (a) a person who intends to be bound by a contract becoming a
          party to the contract;

      (b) a person ceasing to be a party to the contract;

      (c) amending a contract; and

      (d) terminating a contract

      If a Contract Change is ambiguous or its permissibility cannot
      be determined with certainty at the time it is attempted, then
      that change has no effect.

Rule 2198/3 (Power=2)
Making Contract Changes

      Contract changes are secured.  If a contract specifies a
      mechanism by which Contract Changes to it can be performed, then
      such changes CAN be performed using that mechanism.

      If a contract does not purport to regulate becoming a party to
      it, than any person CAN become a party to it by announcement.

      If the minimum number of parties for a contract is at least two,
      then Contract Changes CAN be made to it by agreement between all
      the parties to the contract.  Otherwise, any party to the
      contract CAN make Contract Changes to that contract without
      Objection.  Any party to the contract CAN object to this
      dependent action.

[CFJ 1876 (called 18 January 2008): "Agreement between all parties"
can only exist if there are at least two parties.]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): Agreement between all the parties,
to modify or terminate a contract, can be manifested by a contract
between all the parties, including the contract being modified or
terminated.]

Rule 2178/2 (Power=1.5)
Public Contracts

      A public contract is a contract that has been identified as
      such, as specified by this rule.  Any other contract is private.

      A member of a contract CAN identify it as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership, provided that at least one
      of the following is true:

        (a) The contract contains a clause identifying it as public.

        (b) The publication is accompanied by a notice, indicating
            unanimous consent of members, that the contract be public.

        (c) The publication is accompanied by a notice, published
            without objection of its members, that the contract be
            public.

      A partnership CAN identify its contract as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership.

      If the text of a potential contract is published with a clear
      indication that the contract will be public when it forms, then

Rule 2173/3 (Power=1)
The Notary

      The Notary is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of contracts.

      The parties to a public contract SHALL keep the Notary informed
      of its text and set of parties.  The Notary's weekly report
      includes a list of all public contracts; the Notary's monthly
      report includes each public contract's text and set of parties.

      The parties to a private contract SHOULD keep the Notary
      informed of its text and set of parties.  The Notary SHALL
      disclose this information (to the extent that e has been
      informed of it) to the judge of an equity case pertaining to
      that contract.  The Notary SHALL NOT disclose it otherwise,
      except as explicitly allowed by the contract, or with the
      explicit consent of all parties.

      The Notary CAN terminate any contract without objection.

[CFJ 1786 (called 6 November 2007): The notary is not prohibited from
disclosing eir knowledge or guesses about the historical or current
text and parties of a private contract where e has no privileged

Pledges

      A pledge is a contract identifying itself as such.  A pledge

      An equity case regarding a pledge CAN be initiated by a
      non-party, provided that all other requirements for initiating
      an equity case are met.  The initiator of such a case is
      considered to be a party to the pledge for the purpose of that
      case.

      If a pledge does not impose any ongoing or unsatisfied obligations
      on its current parties, and will not do so in the future in its
      current form, then any person CAN terminate it by announcing that
      it is obsolete.

Rule 2145/4 (Power=2)
Partnerships

      A binding agreement governed by the rules which devolves its
      legal obligations onto a subset of its parties, numbering at
      least two, collectively, is a partnership.  The members of a
      partnership are those parties onto whom the partnership's legal
      obligations are collectively devolved.  A partnership's identity
      and partnershiphood are not disrupted by changes to its
      membership provided that it continues to meet the definition of
      a partnership.

      A partnership's basis is the set consisting of the union of the
      the bases of each of its members.  Where circularity occurs in
      this definition, it is resolved by using the minimum basis sets
      that provide consistency.

      A partnership that is a public contract and whose basis contains
      at least two persons is a person.

[CFJ 1701 (called 11 July 2007): To qualify as a member of a
partnership it is not necessary to be responsible for all of the
partnership's obligations.]

[CFJ 1864 (called 12 January 2008): The devolution of a partnership's
legal obligations onto its members may be achieved by means of a
contract other than the partnership.]

[CFJ 1750 (called 24 September 2007): Partnerships can have non-player
members and nothing in the rules causes a member to cease being so due
to deregistration.]

[CFJ 1855 (called 29 December 2007): A person who is not a party to a
partnership contract cannot have obligations placed on em by that
contract, and so cannot be a member of the partnership.]

Rule 2136/20 (Power=1)
Contests

      Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
      Notary, with a default value of 'none', and a set of possible
      values which consists of all first-class players and 'none'.

      A public contract is a contest if and only if it has a
      contestmaster other than 'none'. The Scorekeepor's report
      contains the contestmaster of each contest.

      Any player CAN flip the contestmaster of a public contract
      without 3 objections, except if doing so would cause a player to
      be contestmaster of more than one contest, or it would flip the
      contestmaster of a contract to a player who has not explicitly
      consented to be contestmaster of that contest.  (If a player
      intends to flip the contestmaster of a contract to emself, this
      is considered explicit consent to be contestmaster of that
      contract.)

      Notwithstanding the rest of this rule, it is IMPOSSIBLE to flip
      the contestmaster of a contract to a player who is not party to
      that contract; and if a contract's contestmaster ceases to be
      party to that contract, that contract's contestmaster is flipped
      to 'none'.

      The total number of points a Contest MAY award in a given week
      is equal to 5 times the number of its members that are first-
      class players.  Points up to this total CAN be awarded by the
      contestmaster to other members by public announcement, and MUST
      be awarded as explicitly described in the contract.

      The total number of points a Contest MAY revoke in a given week
      is equal to 2 times the number of its members that are first-
      class players.  Points up to this total CAN be revoked by the
      contestmaster from other members by public announcement, and
      MUST be revoked as explicitly described in the contract.

      For each contest, ASAP after the beginning of each month, the
      Scorekeepor CAN and SHALL by announcement award a number of
      points, equal to the number of Players who were Contestants in
      that Contest at any time during the previous month, to the
      Player (if any) who was its Contestmaster for 16 or more days
      during the previous month, provided that the Contestmaster
      performed Contest-related duties in a timely manner during that
      time.

Rule 2187/3 (Power=2)
Win by High Score

      Upon a win announcement that one or more players have a score of
      at least 100 (specifying all such players), all those players
      satisfy the Winning Condition of High Score.

      Cleanup procedure:  All those players have eir scores set to 0.
      All other players have eir scores set to floor(N*S/10), where N
      is eir previous score and S is the Score Index.

      The Score Index is an integer from 0 to 5, and part of the
      Scorekeepor's report.  The Scorekeepor CAN change the Score
      Index with Agoran consent.

      If no players have won by High Score in the past four months,
      then any Player may place Agora into Overtime with 3 Support.
      When Agora is in overtime, any announcement awarding or revoking
      points that is authorized by another Rule awards or revokes
      double the amount of the announcement.  Agora ceases being in
      overtime when someone wins by High Score.

Frankenstein's Monster
      A category concerning a monstrous subgame ragarding the cobbling
      together of a rule from salvaged parts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2193/14 (Power=1)
The Monster

      Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

      A public Monster purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.

      There is a format of the Monsterset known as the Short Logical
      Monsterset (SLM).  In this format, each Monster is assigned to a
      category, and the Monsters are grouped according to their
      category.

      Monsters are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Monsterkeepor sees fit.

      When the rules calls for an Agoran Monster to be made, the
      Monster-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:

      (a) Initiation of the Monster.
      (b) Voting of the people.
      (c) Resolution of the Monster.

      Upon the adoption of a proposal awarding a win to one or more
      Monsters, all those Monsters satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Legislation.

      The CotC's report includes the status of all Monster-related
      cases that either require a Monster or have at least one
      applicable Monster-related question that has no judgement.

      "First-class Monster" means a Monster of a biological nature.

      The Monster's adopted motto is "Le monstre n'est pas une
      fontaine."

      The initiation of a Monstrous decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target Monster and the
      changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the specification of
      a Monstrous decree causes it to be void and without effect.
      This is the only mechanism by which a Monstrous decree can be
      initiated.

      If an instance of a switch comes to have a Monster, it ceases to
      have any other Monster.

      A player MAY perform an action on behalf of The Monster with
      Monstrous Consent.

      The holder of a Monster is a Monsterholdor, and may be referred to by
      the name of the Monster. A Monster is imposed if it is so described by
      the rule defining it; otherwise, it is elected.

      Whenever a Monsteredict of GUILTY is assigned in a criminal case
      alleging that a partnership has violated this rule, the Monster SHOULD
      assign an EXILE Monsteredict to the question on sentencing in that case.

      Any Monster (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if:

      (a) the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
          office is vacant, would so require if the office were
          filled

      SHALL act on behalf of the Monster to ensure that the Monster
      fulfills all of its duties.

      The Mad Scientist's weekly duties include the performance of the
      following tasks, in order:

      a) Randomly select exactly one rule.  If the selected rule is
         either this rule or the rule "The Monster", then the
         villagers have shown up with torches and pitchforks; skip
         directly to proposal submission.

      b) Select one or more contiguous sentences from the selected
         rule.

      c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and replace
         each instance of that noun with "Monster" (including
         grammatical variations, e.g. replacing "<noun>'s" with
         "Monster's").

      d) Submit a proposal, with adoption index equal to the Power of
         the selected rule, and interest index 0, to append the
         modified text to the rule "The Monster" (or, if the villagers
         have shown up with torches and pitchforks, to repeal both
         that rule and this one).  This proposal counts as the Mad
         Scientist's weekly report if/when it is adopted.

Rule 2200/1 (Power=1)
Nomic Definitions

      A nomic ruleset is a set of explicit rules that provides means
      for itself to be altered arbitrarily, including changes to those
      rules that govern rule changes. Not all rule changes need be
      possible in one step; an arbitrarily complex combination of
      actions (possibly including intermediate rule changes) can be
      required, so long as any rule change is theoretically achievable
      in finite time.

      A nomic is the single entity defined by a nomic ruleset as a
      whole.  Each nomic ruleset defines exactly one nomic, and each
      nomic is defined by exactly one nomic ruleset.

      A foreign nomic is a nomic that is not Agora. Adopting the name
      of "Agora" does not disqualify a nomic from being foreign; any
      nomic that is not the One True Agora is a foreign nomic.

      A province is a protectorate that is a player.

Rule 2185/0 (Power=1)
Foreign Relations

      Recognition is a foreign nomic switch, tracked by the
      Ambassador, with values Unknown (default), Protected, Friendly,
      Neutral, Sanctioned, Hostile, and Abandoned.

      When a foreign nomic becomes a Protectorate, its Recognition
      becomes Protected.  When a foreign nomic ceases to be a
      Protectorate, its Recognition becomes Unknown.  A foreign
      nomic's Recognition CANNOT change to or from Protected in any
      other way.

      The Ambassador CAN, without objection, flip a foreign nomic's
      Recognition to any value (subject to the above restriction).  E
      SHALL inform that nomic of the change as soon as possible.

Rule 2147/5 (Power=2)
Protectorates

      Whereas Agora, being the superpower of nomics, has an inherent
      responsibility to lead the nomic world; and whereas Agora
      desires to encourage growth and promotion of the nomic
      community, be it hereby known that Agora shall serve as
      benevolent protector to any nomic which requests such status
      (hereafter referred to as the protectorate).

      In order to become a protectorate, a nomic must specify in its
      ruleset that it submits to Agora as its benevolent protector.
      It must also have rules or other gamestate arranged such that
      any protective decree proclaimed by the ambassador will take
      full effect upon proclamation.  Any restriction whatsoever on
      the content of a protective decree disqualifies the nomic from
      being a protectorate.

      If the criteria specified in the preceding paragraph are met,
      the ambassador may make the nomic a protectorate with Agoran
      Consent.  If a protectorate ever does not meet these criteria,
      it ceases to be a protectorate.  The ambassador shall check
      every month whether each protectorate continues to meet the
      criteria, and shall announce whenever a protectorate has ceased
      to be a protectorate.

      The ambassador's report includes a list of all protectorates,
      with contact details for each, and for each the forum in which
      it is most appropriate to proclaim protective decrees that
      target that protectorate.

[Note (25 July 2007): Suggested wording for a protectorate's ruleset:
"Any protective decree of Agora that targets this nomic takes effect
as specified by the rules of Agora.".]

[CFJ 1707 (called 20 July 2007): If a nomic's ruleset contains a
statement similar to "This nomic allows Agora unrestricted access to
make changes to its ruleset.", this can be interpreted as "This
nomic's rules change whenever the rules of Agora say they do.", thus
satisfying the requirement to make protective decrees effective [at
the time of CFJ 1707, the vaguer requirement to allow Agora to change
its ruleset].]

Rule 2159/2 (Power=2)
Protective Decrees

      A protective decree is an act of Agora the intended effect of
      which is to make explicit changes to the state of a protectorate
      nomic.  The changes may include enacting, repealing, or amending
      rules of the protectorate, changing the set of players of the
      protectorate, or any other instantaneous changes to the
      protectorate's gamestate.

      The initiation of a protective decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target protectorate and
      the changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the
      specification of a protective decree causes it to be void and
      without effect.  This is the only mechanism by which a
      protective decree can be initiated.

      As soon as possible after a protective decree has been
      initiated, the ambassador SHALL proclaim it to the target nomic.
      The decree takes effect upon this proclamation.

      Protective decrees should be initiated only for the purpose of
      assisting the protectorate in its growth and enabling its
      longevity.  Protective decrees should always be benevolent.

      All players are prohibited from falsely claiming, to any nomic,
      that a document is a protective decree.

[CFJ 1860 (called 8 January 2008): Falsely claiming, to an entity that
is neither a nomic nor a means of contacting a nomic, that a document
is a protective decree is not a violation of rule 2159.]

      A player CAN spend some of eir assets to export them to a
      foreign nomic; e SHALL inform that nomic of the export as soon
      as possible, preferably by simultaneously sending the
      announcement to an appropriate foreign forum.

      The Ambassador SHOULD encourage foreign nomics to adopt
      legislation recognizing Agoran exports by creating comparable
      foreign assets.

Rule 1727/17 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic, known
      unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played on,
      until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

      BE IT FURTHERMORE RESOLVED that Agora's Unbirthday is defined to
      be the entire day of December 30, GMT +1200, of each year; but,
      since that falls within a Holiday, is observed during the entire
      days of January 12 through 14, GMT +1200, of each year.
