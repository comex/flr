The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name Is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

History:
Created by Proposal 913, ca. May 4 1994
Transmuted from MI=1 to MI=Unanimity by Proposal 1020, Sep. 4 1994
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1484, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.
 CFJ 1132, Judged May 18, 1999: A Player failing to perform a duty
 required by the Rules within a reasonable time may be in violation
 of the Rules, even if the Rules do not provide a time limit for
 the performance of that duty.]

Amended(1) by Proposal 3915 (harvel), Sep. 27 1999

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/4 (Power=2)
Definition of Nomic Property

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity the value of
      which is defined by the Rules.  Other Rules may define
      procedures by which the value of a Nomic Property may be
      changed.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]

Rule 1527/3 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one action -- such as a
      notification, report, or other communication -- on which the
      Rules place some legal significance, the actions in that message
      shall be taken to have been sent sequentially in the order which
      they appear in the message.

      If a message attempts to perform multiple actions simultaneously
      without explicitly stating a specific order for the actions,
      then the attempt shall be considered ambiguous and without
      effect if the gamestate would be substantively different for any
      two orderings of the actions. For the purposes of this test, the
      actual order the actions are performed in is not considered
      substantive, but other differences may, at the discretion of a
      judge, be considered substantive.

Rule 754/5 (Power=3)
Freedom of Communication

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) No Player shall be prohibited from participating in the
          Fora.

      (2) No Player shall be punished for accurately quoting a Rule,
          Proposal, Statement, Judgement, another Player, or another
          reference.

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (3) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (4) A term explicitly defined by the Rules shall be interpreted
          as having that meaning, as shall its ordinary-language
          synonyms not explicitly defined by the rules.  In
          particular, the term "number" shall be interpreted as "real
          number".

      (5) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, shall
          be interpreted as having the meaning it has in those
          contexts.

      (6) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          shall be interpreted as having its ordinary-language
          meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

Rule 1497/8 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of evidence submitted in support of a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement, or in response to a Judicial or
      Appellate Order requiring that Player to disclose information
      known to that Player, commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of a public message, as any part of a response to a request for
      information where that Player was required to respond, or as
      part of a message to an Officer upon which that Officer is then
      required to act, commits the Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.

      For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be considered
      an Officer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, for a Player to "willfully make a
      false statement of fact", all of the following conditions must
      be true at the time the Player makes the statement.

        a) The Player must present the statement as if it were true.

        b) The Player must know that the statement is false.  In
           particular, the following things are not willful: excusable
           negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable reliance on the
           representations of another.

        c) The statement is not a conclusion as to the interpretation
           of the Rules, or as to their application to a particular
           situation.

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

Rule 1926/1 (Power=1)
The Official Secrets Act

      The Rules may designate certain pieces of information to
      be secret. Any player who knowingly reveals secret information
      to another player, except as explicitly permitted or required
      by the rules, commits the Crime of Unlawful Disclosure, a Class
      5 Crime. All secret information is deemed private, with respect
      to the Freedom of Information Act.

Rule 1478/5 (Power=1)
Executors and Limited Executors

      (a) An Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
          Rules to act on behalf of that entity, who is called the
          Executee. There may be more than one such Player. An
          Executor of an Executee may perform on behalf of the
          Executee all such actions as the Rules permit the Executee
          to perform.

      (b) A Limited Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered
          by the Rules to perform on behalf of that entity a subset of
          the actions which the Rules permit the entity to perform. A
          Limited Executor is permitted to perform on behalf of an
          Executee only such actions as are explicitly permitted by
          the Rules.

      (c) A Player is always eir own Executor. Other entities have
          Executors (or Limited Executors) only as and when the Rules
          provide.

      (d) A Player acting on behalf of an entity other than emself
          must clearly indicate on whose behalf e is acting. A Player
          who does not clearly indicate that e is acting on behalf of
          some entity other than emself is presumed to be acting on
          eir own behalf.

      (e) Only persons may perform actions. Non-persons perform
          actions only via the agency of persons, as specified by the
          Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1989/1 (Power=1)
Prime Executors

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

      (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime
          Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action must
          be an Executor of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that
          entity who is permitted to perform that action on behalf of
          that entity.

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.

      (e) If a Player is the sole Executor of an entity, then e is the
          Prime Executor of that entity. This provision does not apply
          to a Player who is the sole Limited Executor, but not the
          Executor, of an entity.

Rule 1727/13 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June
      30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First
      Speaker Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think
          we may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules
          are invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was
      played on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official
      name of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the
      hard work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent
      advice of Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as soon as possible after the end
      of Agora's Birthday, the Herald shall award the boon of
      celebration to each Player who, during Agora's Birthday,
      publicly recognized Agora's Birthday;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Herald may select one Contest,
      in existence on Agora's Birthday, which has as its purpose
      encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday.  Within the
      month following Agora's Birthday, that Contest may award its
      Members the Patent Title Nth Anniversary Ribbon, where N is the
      number of years of Agora's existence;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of
      Appeals, Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's
      Birthday; nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the
      Courts a Call For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge,
      Judgement, call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's
      Birthday; nor shall any Player submit an Application to Submit
      an Opinion on Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do
      take place on Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this
      Rule does not deprive them of their usual effects.

Rule 1586/2 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      No two Rule-defined entities shall have the same name or
      nickname.

      If the Rules defining some entity are repealed or amended
      such that they no longer define that entity, then that
      entity along with all its properties shall cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they
      still define that entity but with different properties,
      that entity and its properties shall continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

Rule 2040/1 (Power=2)
Switches

      A switch is a set of states associated with a class of entities.
      Each switch shall have a default state, which if not otherwise
      specified shall be the first state mentioned in the rule
      defining the switch.

      The recordkeepor for a class of entities shall also maintain
      records of any switches associated with that class, as well as
      the current state of the switch for each entity of the class.
      If the recordkeepor is required to publish a report, that report
      shall include records of these switches.  The rules may require
      a different player to maintain and report these records.

      Whenever an entity is created in a class of entities associated
      with a switch, it shall be in the state of the switch specified
      by the order or provision creating it; if no state is specified,
      it shall be in the default state of the switch.

      Whenever an entity joins a class of entities associated with a
      switch, the entity shall be in the default state of the switch.

      A player who may flip a switch on an entity to some state may do
      so by announcement.  In eir announcement, e must indicate the
      entity, switch, and new state.  When a switch on an entity is
      flipped to some state, the entity shall come to be in that state
      and simultaneously cease to be in any other state of the switch.

      A switch is loose unless the rules define it as stuck.

      An executor of an entity may flip any of the loose switches on
      that entity, unless the rules otherwise prohibit doing so.

      The stuck switches on an entity can be flipped only when the
      rules so indicate.

      Whenever a switch is created, or becomes associated with a class
      of entities, then each entity in the class that had previously
      been in a state that is now a state of the switch shall continue
      to be in that state; all other entities in the class shall be in
      the default state of the switch.

Rule 478/13 (Power=1)
Fora

      Publicity is a stuck forum switch with values null, Discussion,
      and Public.

      The Registrar may, without objection, flip the publicity of a
      forum.  In addition to any other requirements the rules place on
      this action, the Registrar's announcement of intent must be sent
      to that forum, and if the forum is being made Public, then the
      announcement by which the Registrar performs the modification
      must be sent to all existing Public fora.

      It is the responsibility of each active player to ensure that e
      can receive messages via each Public forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all Public or
      Discussion fora and sufficient data regarding each such forum to
      allow players to receive messages via that medium.  The
      Registrar need not keep track of fora with null state.

      A message is not public unless some rule states that it is
      public.  A message is public if it is sent via a Public forum,
      or if it is sent to all players via a combination of fora and
      contains a clear designation of intent to be public.

      A player publishes information by publicly sending a message
      containing that information, and announces something by
      publishing it.

      If the rules state that a player may perform an action by
      announcement, then that player may perform that action by
      announcing that e performs it.  If the rules state that a player
      may perform an action by private message to some player, then
      that player may perform that action by sending a message
      privately to the specified player indicating that e performs it.
      In either case, such a message must unambiguously describe the
      action to be performed.

[CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
 all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.

Rule 459/5 (Power=1)
Agoran Epochs

      Days, weeks, months, quarters, and years are epochs.  The
      corresponding Agoran epochs are Agoran days, Agoran weeks,
      Agoran months, Agoran quarters, and Agoran years, respectively.

      Agoran days begin at midnight GMT.  Agoran weeks begin at
      midnight GMT on Monday.  Agoran months begin at midnight GMT on
      the first day of each Gregorian month.  Agoran quarters begin
      when the Agoran months of January, April, July, and October
      begin.  Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
      begins.  An Agoran epoch lasts until the next Agoran epoch of
      the same type begins.

      Except in this Rule, when the Rules refer to an epoch as an
      independent entity (e.g. "each month"), they shall be
      interpreted as referring to the corresponding Agoran epoch.
      However, when the Rules refer to an epoch as a relative duration
      (e.g. "one month after", "within one month", "for one month"),
      they shall be interpreted as referring to the ordinary-language
      meaning of that duration.

      Automatic events that happen daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,
      or yearly happen at the beginning of the corresponding Agoran
      epoch.  Any activity that must be performed daily, weekly,
      monthly, quarterly, or yearly must be performed at least once
      during each corresponding Agoran epoch.

      Other Rules may explicitly define alternate schedules for events
      or classes of events.

Rule 1274/2 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      An Index (plural: Indices) is a Nomic Property.  The value of an
      Index shall be either a non-negative real number or the special
      value Unanimity.

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

Rule 1023/16 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      A requirement to perform an action "as soon as possible" is a
      requirement to perform the action within a week.

      If a Player fails to observe such a requirement, and no other
      Rule defines a penalty for the failure, then the Player commits
      the Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness, which may be reported by
      any Player.

      This Rule does not prevent late actions from taking effect, but
      merely penalizes the Player for being late.

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      non-active Players without conflicting with this Rule.

[CFJ 1075: Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with
 lower precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
 purely discussionary nature.]

Rule 1079/3 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      (a) When a Rule requires a random choice to be made, then the
          choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution
          among the possible outcomes the Rules provide for making
          that choice. If the Rules do not specify a probability
          distribution, then a uniform probability distribution shall
          be used.

      (b) Where the Rules do not indicate who is required to make a
          particular random choice, it shall be made by the Speaker.

      (c) When making a random choice as required by the Rules, a
          Player may rely on any physical or computational process
          whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes
          is reasonably close to that required by the Rules.

      (d) For the purposes of this Rule, tossing a platonic solid or
          coin that is not specially weighted has a probability
          distribution among the possible outcomes that is reasonably
          close to uniform.

      (e) For other methods, the Courts are the final arbiter of
          whether a method's probability distribution among the
          possible outcomes is reasonably close to that required by
          the Rules.

[CFJ 790 contains a detailed discussion on what does and does not
 qualify as a random choice.]

Rule 1769/2 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 17 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins within
      72 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays and the
      time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless this
      would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 17 days in length, in
      which case the first Holiday is extended to 17 days and the
      second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      There exists a Boon known as Shiny New Toy, and an Albatross

      with a Stain of at least one Blot are known as Naughty, and
      Players with a Stain of less than one Blot are known as Nice.

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power (low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858)
 Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule of higher Power to
 mean something other than its ordinary English meaning, that
 may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does must be
 decided on a case-by-case basis.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

[CFJs 1114 and 1115 (both Judged Feb. 5 1999): This Rule is to be
 applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just
 because a Rule is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict
 with a Rule of higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is
 nullified in all cases.]

Rule 1513/4 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      The Rules may grant to certain entities the power to require
      Players to perform (or refrain from performing) actions.  Such
      Entities shall have whatever power is granted to them by the
      Rules.  In the event that the requirements of such an Entity
      conflicts with the Rules, the Rules shall always take
      precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity mentioned
      first in that Rule takes precedence over the others.

      No entity (including any body of text) may require a Player to
      perform or refrain from performing any action unless that
      Player has previously been provided with the information of
      which actions may be required of or prohibited em by that

The Players
  This Category includes Rules defining and classifying Players.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/14 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      Any person who is not registered as a Player may do so by
      sending a message to a Public Forum stating that e registers as
      a Player.  Unless other Rules provide additional necessary
      conditions for registration that have not been fulfilled or the
      Rules otherwise prohibit the person from registering, e
      immediately becomes a registered Player.

      Readiness is a stuck player switch with values ready and
      unready.

      An unready player may flip eir readiness to ready.

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 365 previous days, e becomes Unready and is subject
      to a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration
      and ends sixty days afterwards, unless otherwise provided by
      this Rule.  A Player is only subject to the Grace Period
      resulting from eir own registration.

      Whenever:

      (i) any Holiday occurs completely between the start of any
          Player's Grace Period and its scheduled conclusion, or

      (ii) any Player's Grace Period is scheduled to conclude during
           any Holiday,

      eir Grace Period shall be extended by a period of time equal in
      length to that Holiday.

      Whenever a Player registers during a Holiday, eir Grace Period
      shall be extended by a period of time equal to the time which
      elapses between eir registration and the conclusion of that
      Holiday, provided that no other Rule extends eir Grace Period by
      reason of that Holiday.

      For the purposes of determining when a Player's Grace Period is
      scheduled to conclude, where more than one Holiday falls fully
      or partially within that Grace Period, the calculation shall be
      made separately for each Holiday.

      Whenever a Player's Grace Period concludes, e becomes Ready.


[CFJ 805: "Person" here means a natural person, not a legal person
 (such as a corporation) or something named "person."
 CFJ 1263: Any message expressing a clear desire or intent to register
 as a Player counts as a request for registration, whether or not it
 is explicitly phrased as a request.]

      A player may flip eir activity, unless e has done so within the
      past week.

      Inactive players may not vote, make proposals, hold office, or
      be a judge of a CFJ.  An inactive player may not be required by
      the rules to perform any duty or action, unless the rules
      explicitly state that they can require inactive players to
      perform that duty or action.

      This rule takes precedence over all other rules that regulate
      activity, or the powers or duties that a player may have because
      of eir activity.

[CFJ 718: Because of Rule 1011, a Player may not be placed On Hold
 except as specified in the Rules.]

Rule 1043/5 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a public message announcing eir deregistration. A Player
      who deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective
      at the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em
      to reregister before thirty days have passed are without effect.
      This Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause em to be
      reregistered before thirty days have passed after eir
      deregistration.

[CFJ 810: If a Player deregisters as well as doing other things
 in the same message, Rule 1527 applies.]

Rule 1042/20 (Power=1)
Deregistration Due to Silence

      Noisiness is a stuck player switch with values noisy, quiet, and
      silent.

      A non-noisy player becomes noisy whenever e posts to a public
      forum.

      A player may flip another player's noisiness from noisy to
      quiet, unless e has done so for another player within the past
      24 hours.

      If a player has been quiet continuously for one month, or
      inactive continuously for three months, e becomes silent.

      Any player may publish a Notice of Abandonment, identifying
      another player and alleging that that player has abandoned the
      game. A Notice of Abandonment is or becomes invalid if the
      player identified in it is not, or ceases to be, silent.

Rule 2036/1 (Power=1)
The Silent Treatment

      (a) The publication of a Notice of Abandonment commences the
          Silent Treatment for the player identified in it.

      (b) The requirement to perform the actions described in this
          Rule is subject to the Notice of Abandonment remaining
          valid. If at any time during the Silent Treatment the Notice
          of Abandonment is invalid, then the Treatment is terminated,
          and the Registrar is relieved of all powers and
          responsibilities regarding it.

      (c) As soon as possible after the commencement of the Silent
          Treatment, the Registrar shall:

          (1) publically confirm whether the Notice of Abandonment was
              valid at the commencement of the Silent Treatment, and
              whether it remains valid;

          (2) publish in all designated Public Fora, and send to each
              listed e-mail address of the player, a Notice of Intent
              to Deregister, identifying the player to be deregistered
              (the same as in the Notice of Abandonment), and
              announcing the Registrar's intent to deregister that
              player after one month has passed.

      (d) If the Notice of Abandonment remains valid a month after the
          publication of the Notice of Intent to Deregister, then the
          Registrar shall, as soon as possible, publish in all
          designated Public Fora, and send to each listed e-mail
          address of the player, a Notice of Deregistration,
          identifying the player being deregistered (the same as in
          the Notice of Abandonment). A Notice of Deregistration is
          valid if and only if it is published by the Registrar,
          following the procedures described in this Rule.

      (e) Upon publication of a valid Notice of Deregistration, the
          following events occur in order:

          (1) if the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration
              is the Speaker, e commits the Class 15 Crime of Speaker
              Abandonment; e ceases to be Speaker, and the
              Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker;

          (2) the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration is
              deregistered;

          (3) the Silent Treatment for that player concludes.

Rule 1789/2 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Write of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

Rule 1755/6 (Power=1)

      which the rules assign any duties or powers.  No one who is not
      registered may occupy such a role or position, unless at least
      one of the rules defining the role or position explicitly
      indicate it may be occupied by a nonplayer.

      Bearing a Patent Title shall not be deemed to be occupying a
      role or position.

      This rule shall not act to prevent a nonplayer from registering,
      calling for judgement, or otherwise doing things that nonplayers
      are generally able to do.

Rule 1841/5 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      (a) A Player (the Grantor) who has been continuously registered
          for more than two months is empowered to give eir Power of
          Attorney (PoA) to another Player (the Holder), as specified
          in this Rule.

      (b) The Holder holds the Grantor's PoA if all of the following
          conditions are met:
          (1) the Grantor has announced that e grants eir PoA to the
              Holder;
          (2) the Holder has, in the week immediately preceding or
              immediately following the Grantor's announcement,
              publically consented to hold the Grantor's PoA;
          (3) the Holder is Active; and
          (4) the grant of PoA has not been withdrawn for any of the
              reasons listed in (d).

      (c) The grant of PoA commences at the time the Grantor grants
          eir PoA to the Holder, or at the time the Holder consents to
          the grant, or at the time specified by the Grantor,
          whichever is latest. If the Grantor specifies a time at
          which the grant of PoA is to commence, it must be a time no
          more than seven says from the Grantor's announcement. Later
          specifications are without effect for the purposes of this
          Rule.

      (d) The grant of PoA is withdrawn if:
          (1) the period of the grant specified by the Grantor
              expires;
          (2) the Grantor publically withdraws the grant;
          (3) the Grantor is deregistered;
          (4) the Holder ceases to be active or is deregistered; or
          (5) the Holder has held the PoA continuously for three
              months.

      (e) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed as preventing other
          Rules from granting and withdrawing PoA by other means.

      (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
          has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
          shall be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect.

Rule 1686/11 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      The Rules may designate certain information to be part of an
      Office's Weekly Report or Monthly Report.  An Office's Weekly
      Reports and Monthly Reports constitute the Office's Official
      Report.  All information that is part of an Office's Official
      Report shall be maintained by the corresponding officer.

      The rules may specify conditions under which a player is mauve;
      that player is not mauve unless the rules explicitly state at
      least one such condition and all such conditions are satisfied.
      As soon as possible after a player becomes mauve, the Speaker
      shall announce this fact.  The only condition for mauveness is
      being nicknamed Blob.

      Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly; each
      officer with a Monthly Report must publish it monthly.  Failure
      to do so is the Class 2 Infraction of Failure to Report.  If an
      officer fails to do so for at least three consecutive reporting
      periods, e may be cited for either Failure to Report or the
      Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of Duty but not both.  Any
      officer cited for Dereliction of Duty is immediately removed
      from that office. The Assistant Director of Personnel and the
      Speaker may report these Infractions.

Rule 1431/16 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a public message claiming that a specific
      public communication misrepresents the actual Game State, and
      documenting the nature of the error.  The person who sent the
      original communication is hereafter known as the Journalist, and
      the portion of the communication claimed to be in error is
      hereafter known as the Yellow Document.

      A Response to a Claim of Error is a public message from the
      Journalist that either admits or denies the claim.  An admission
      is not valid until the Journalist posts a corrected version of
      the Yellow Document.

      If the Journalist was required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e must publish a
      Response as soon as possible, unless one of the following holds:

        a) E has already published a correction.
        b) A previous Claim was made concerning the same error.
        c) The Claim was posted more than three weeks after the Yellow
           Document.
        d) The Claim is in dispute.  If the Claim ceases to be in
           dispute, then the Journalist must publish a Response as
           soon as possible after it ceases to be in dispute.

      If the Journalist was not required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e is encouraged (but
      not required) to publish a Response in a timely fashion.

      A Player who incorrectly denies a Claim commits the Class 1
      Crime of Implausible Deniability.  However, if e admits the
      Claim within three days after the incorrect denial, then e shall
      not be convicted of this Crime.

[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]

Ratification Without Objection

      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

        i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
           permissible to Ratify.
       ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
           holding the Office.
      iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
           produced and maintained by the Officer.

      A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official
      Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally
      permissible to Ratify.

      A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by
      the Rules to constitute an Objection.

[CFJ 1207 (14 April 2000) found that this rule allows a report to be
 ratified by an Officer, even in the face of Rule 1550, which requires
 that the only instrument capable of ratifying a report be a
 Proposal.  In effect, Players are not instruments.]

Rule 1551/5 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time the Document was
      published.  In other words, the State of the Game, upon such
      ratification, becomes that specified within the Document, plus
      all subsequent legal changes between the time of its publication
      and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published, even
      to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or illegal move, or an
      Order.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
      allow such retroactive alterations or corrections to the Game
      State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified.

Rule 1552/4 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      An Official Document is legally permissible to Ratify if and
      only if all of the following are true:

      a) The Rules required some specific Player to produce and/or
         maintain the document.

      b) The Rules required it to be published.  (A requirement that
         it be sent to all Players fulfills this criterion.)

      c) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error (COE).

      d) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for Judgement
         (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.

      e) The information within the Document has not been superseded
         by a subsequent Document that contradicts it.  (This does not
         apply if a COE alleging the contradiction is in error is
         admitted.)

      f) The Document is not the Ruleset.  The Ruleset is specifically
         excluded from Ratification.

      Ratification by Proposal is effective only if the Document is
      legally permissible to Ratify when the Proposal takes effect.

Installing Officers through Proposal

      A Player may be Installed into an Office by the adoption of a

      that Player is removed from the Office. The Player named in the
      Proposal then becomes the Electee to that Office.

Rule 1555/8 (Power=1)
Electees and Removal from Office

      A Player who wins an Election for an Office, or is installed
      into Office by a Proposal, becomes the Electee to that Office,
      as well as its holder.

      When the Electee to an Office is retired from that Office, e
      ceases to be the Electee to that Office, but continues to hold
      the Office.

      When the Electee to an Office is removed from that Office, e
      ceases to be Electee to that Office. Furthermore, if the Electee
      currently holds the Office, the Speaker becomes the holder of
      that Office, unless another Rule provides that a different
      Player is to hold the Office.

      When a non-Electee is removed from an Office and there is an
      Electee to that Office, then the Electee becomes the holder of
      the Office. If there is no Electee, the Office is held by the
      Speaker.

      Whenever a player deregisters, is deregistered, or ceases to be
      active, e is removed from all Offices e holds.

Rule 1758/6 (Power=1)
Holding an Office in Perpetuity

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,
      then the Assistant Director of Personnel may declare, Without
      Objection, that that Player holds that Office in perpetuity.
      The Player then holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office.  If
      a Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office
      to another Player, and e is still the Electee to the Office at
      the end of the Period of Delegation, then e resumes holding the
      Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

Rule 1645/9 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      An Office is Delegated when all of these conditions are met:

        (a) The holder (hereafter known as the Delegating Player)
            publishes a Notice of Delegation, naming the Office,
            another Player (hereafter known as the Delegated Player),
            and a Period of Delegation no longer than three weeks.

        (b) The Delegating Player is Electee to the Office, or is the
            Speaker.  This condition must hold when e publishes the
            Notice of Delegation, and must also hold at the beginning
            of the Period of Delegation.

        (c) The Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
            Office at the beginning of the Period of Delegation.

        (d) The Delegated Player consents to the Delegation within
            seven days of the publication of the Notice of Delegation.

        (e) The Period of Delegation has begun and not yet ended.

      The Period of Delegation begins when the Notice of Delegation is
      published, or when consent is given, or at the time (if any)
      specified in the Notice of Delegation, whichever is latest.

      The Period of Delegation ends after the duration specified in
      the Notice of Delegation has elapsed, or when a Player other
      than the Delegating Player becomes Electee to the Office.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player holds the
      Office, and earns its Salary as specified by other Rules.

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, if the Office has an
      Electee, then the Electee holds the Office; otherwise, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office.

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to

      The Officer is Impeached when such a Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voters do not include the Officer
      under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must be
      greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Rule 1665/2 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class 4
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as

      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

 such that a Player who is newly installed into an Office does not
 commit the Infraction of Failure to Report (insofar as that Office is
 subject to such duties) if e posts the required Report within a week
 of eir being installed into Office."

      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to
      the next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who fails to do

Rule 1728/11 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer.  The phrase
      "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection",
      and the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N players have publicly posted objections
                to the performance of the action; or

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N players other than the player who made the
                announcement under (a) of this rule have publicly
                posted support for the performance of the action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections
           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit
           the action to be performed Without N Objections or do not
           permit the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

      (g)  e announces that e performs the described action.

      A dependent action is not performed until announced as in (g).

      A player who posts an objection to the performance of an action
      may publicly retract eir objection.  If e does so, e shall be
      deemed not have posted an objection to the performance of that
      action for the purposes of (e)(1) of this rule.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      A rule authorising the performance of a dependent action may
      restrict the eligibility of players to support or object to that
      specific action.

Rule 1664/25 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      A Rebellious player may Call for a Revolt at any time by
      publicly announcing e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if no other Call for Revolt has been made that week
      and no successful Revolt has occurred for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and publicly announce the result.

      The Registrar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of players (plus 1 if Miscreant is Borne). If this number is
      less than or equal to the number of Rebellious players (plus
      1 if Miscreant is Borne by a Rebellious player), then the
      Revolt succeeds; otherwise it fails. All numbers used in this
      calculation are determined at the time of the Call for Revolt.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur in order:

         - The Registrar shall expunge the Blots of each Rebellious
           player
         - The Registrar shall grant the ephemeral Patent Title Rebel
           Hero to each Rebellious player.
         - All Stock Cards in the possession of Abiding Players are
           returned to the Deck
         - Each Abiding player that is the Electee to an Office is
           retired from that Office.
         - All Rebellious players become Abiding again
         - A Speaker Transition occurs

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious players gain 2 Blots.
         - The player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The effects of a Call for Revolt shall be based on the Political
      Status of players at the time of the Call.

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all Blots gained or
      expunged as a result of this Rule.

Rule 1988/0 (Power=2)
Bastille Day

      July 14 of each year shall be known as Bastille Day.  For a
      Revolt called on this day the normal procedure is modified, as
      follows:

         i) Each Rebellious Player shall count twice for the purpose
            of determining success if, during that Bastille Day, e
            publicly hums a few bars of 'La Marseillaise'.

            This includes the determination of the number of players,
            and the Miscreant adjustment, which may become 2 rather
            than 1.

        ii) On success, rather than having all eir Blots expunged,
            each Rebellious Player shall be left with 1 Blot each,
            even if e was previously Immaculate.

      This Rule takes precedence over the normal Revolt Procedure.

Political Status

      Orthodoxy is a stuck player switch with values abiding and

      A player may flip eir orthodoxy, unless e has done so during the
      current month.

      At the beginning of each month, each Rebellious Player commits
      the Class 2 Infraction of Inciting to Riot (to be reported by
      the Registrar), unless all of the following are true at that
      time:

        i) The Registrar has not announced whether the last Call for
           Revolt succeeded or failed.
       ii) The Player was Rebellious at the time of the last Call for
           Revolt.
      iii) The Player has not changed from Abiding to Rebellious since
           the last Call for Revolt.

      in which case the Player is Hauled Into Kangaroo Court instead.

      When a Call for Revolt fails, each Player Hauled Into Kangaroo
      Court since the Call for Revolt commits the Infraction of
      Inciting to Riot, as defined above.

Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals, and the Proposal Pool.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/9 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute
      publishes a body of text with the clear indication that it is
      intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text becomes a
      Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes the
      Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as Proposing or
      submitting a Proposal.

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.

      The publishing of the Proposal Pool never creates new
      Proposals.

      All Players are Legislators.  A Player is Mute while e has more
      than 5 Blots.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply Rule
      Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even Rule
      Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in valid media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.  For
      the purposes of this rule, print and electronic media, including

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

Rule 594/8 (Power=3)
Power and Proposals

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.  Except as
      described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power of any
      entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing the Power to be
      so set.  No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power
      greater than its own.

      When a Proposal takes effect, its Power shall be set equal to
      its Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of
      the Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by
      the Rules.

      Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
      ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each
      provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

Adoption Indices

      1) The Default Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of:

         a) 1; and

         b) any minimum values required for that Proposal by the
            Rules.

      2) The Proposer of a Proposal may, at the time when e submits
         the Proposal or at any time while it is in the Pool, request
         an Adoption Index for that Proposal by announcement,
         specifying the requested value.

      3) When a Proposal is distributed, its Adoption Index is set to
         the maximum of:

         a) its Default Adoption Index; and

         b) any values requested by its Proposer as permitted in 2).

      4) This is the only mechanism for setting or changing the
         Adoption Index of a Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence
         over Rules that would allow other mechanisms for setting or
         changing the Adoption Index of a Proposal.

      e has five or more Blots, in which case eir Voting Power is
      zero; all other entities have a Voting Power of zero on Sane
      Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine the
      Voting Power of entities.

Rule 2016/1 (Power=2)
Contested Proposals

      (a) A null Proposal is a Proposal containing no provisions,
          i.e., one that does not propose any Rule Changes, or any
          other changes to the game state.

      (b) Any Player may make a null Proposal Distributable without
          payment of the usual Fee, provided that no other null
          Proposal in the current Agoran Month has been made
          Distributable under this provision.

      (c) The first null Proposal to be distributed in each Agoran
          Month is a Contested Proposal.

      (d) A Contested Proposal is Democratic.

      (e) Notwithstanding the prevailing Mode of Voting on Proposals,
          voting on a Contested Proposal is always Unrestricted. This
          Rule takes precedence over Rules that determine the
          permissible methods for casting votes on Proposals.

      (f) If a Contested Proposal fails Quorum, no Points are Awarded.

      (g) If a Contested Proposal achieves Quorum, but fails, each
          Player who voted against the Proposal and did not vote for
          it may be Awarded 10 Points.

      (h) If a Contested Proposal is adopted, each Player who voted
          for the Proposal and did not vote against it may be Awarded
          10 Points.

Rule 1770/16 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      (a) The Promotor is permitted to distribute a Distributable
          Proposal at any time.

      (b) During each Week, the Promotor is required to distribute
          every Proposal that was Distributable at the beginning of
          that Week, unless the Proposal has since ceased to be
          Distributable.

      (c) If there were no Distributable Proposals at the beginning of
          the Week, then the Promotor is required publically to note
          this fact at some time during the Week.

      (d) Failure by the Promotor to either distribute Proposals as
          required in (b), or to make an announcement as required in
          (c), is the Class 1 Infraction of Promotor Tardiness, which
          any Player may report.

      (e) The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
          Proposal the identity of its Proposing Entity, its Adoption
          Index, and an indication of the Proposal's Chamber. However,
          the failure of the Promotor to include any of these
          accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
          distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      (f) A Proposal is legally distributed only if it is accompanied
          by an explicit indication that it is being distributed. When
          a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
          Pool.

      (g) The Promotor shall not distribute any Proposal which is not
          Distributable, and must abort any Proposal so distributed.
          If the Promotor aborts a Proposal which e knows was
          Distributable at the time it was distributed, e commits the
          Class 2 Crime of Illegal Abortion.

      (h) The Promotor aborts a Proposal by publishing an announcement
          to that effect, clearly identifying the Proposal which has
          been aborted.

      (i) The distribution of an Undistributable Proposal, when the
          Promotor knows that the Proposal is Undistributable, is the
          Class 2 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation.  The
          distribution of a text purporting to be a Proposal, when the
          Promotor knows that the text is not a Proposal, is the Class
          5 Crime of Promotor Fraud.

[In upholding the Judgement of CFJ 1089, the Board of Appeals held
 that in order for a Proposal to have been legally distributed, it is
 necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) that some text with
 demonstrably the same effects as the Proposal have been distributed.]

Rule 1726/1 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is submitted by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its submission, it takes effect when submitted.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

A Proposal's Chamber

      Chamber is a stuck switch for Proposals with values Ordinary and

      An Ordinary Proposal with Adoption Index of two (2) or greater
      is a Stalled Proposal.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a
      Stalled Proposal may not be distributed.  If a proposal is
      distributed that was Stalled at the time of distribution, the
      Promotor shall abort it as soon as possible.

      Every Proposal is initially Democratic, unless its Adoption
      Index is less than two (2), in which case it is initially
      Ordinary.  The Chamber of a Proposal may only be changed as
      specified by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to
      two (2).

            (1) A Shareholder: eir Share Holdings;
            (2) Any other entity: zero.

      (b) An entity's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as
          follows:

            * A Player:
                  (a) two plus that Player's Voting Potential if that
                      Player has zero Share Holdings.
                  (b) one plus that Player's Voting Potential
                      otherwise.

            * Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
              default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting
              power on a Democratic Proposal for that entity.

      (c) The value of an entity's Voting Power for any given Chamber
          at the beginning of each Week shall be in effect for all
          Proposals distributed during that Week. However, if a
          Proposal's Chamber is changed after it has been distributed,
          the Voting Power of each entity for that Proposal is
          redetermined at the time the Chamber is changed.

      (d) An entity may cast as many votes as e wishes on a Proposal,
          in any combination, up to the limit determined by that
          entity's Voting Power on that Proposal, with the exceptions
          that:
              (1) no Player may vote on an Ordinary Proposal unless e
                  is a Shareholder at the time e casts eir vote.

Voting on Proposals

      A Voter authorised to cast votes on a particular Proposal may do

      casting on that Proposal. Once cast, a vote cannot be changed or
      cancelled by the Voter which cast it, although it may be

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

Rule 2021/3 (Power=2)
Chamber Procedure

      (a) The Chamber Fee for a Proposal is a Fee for changing the
          Chamber of a Proposal.  For any given Proposal, the Chamber
          Fee is initially 1.

      (b) When a Proposal's Chamber is changed via this Rule:
          (1) the Chamber Fee for the Proposal is doubled; and
          (2) if the Proposal is in its Voting Period, it is Aborted
              as described elsewhere, and returned to the Proposal
              Pool with its Distributability and other characteristics
              intact.

      (c) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
          Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which
          the Voting Period has not ended. If the Speaker Sanitises a
          Proposal, the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere;
          the Proposal remains Distributable, but becomes Democratic
          and Sane.

Rule 1764/12 (Power=1)
Modes of Voting

      There are three classes of Issues: Proposals, Elections, and
      Referenda.

      (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
          Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the
          prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.

      (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
               for Proposals, with Support.

           (2) The Assistant Director of Personnel may change the
               prevailing mode of voting for Elections, with Support.

           (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

      (c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of
          voting for that particular Issue is permanently set to the
          prevailing mode for that class of Issue.

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voters on that
               Issue, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
               Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may only be achieved by sending a
               message privately to the Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may be achieved by sending a message
               either publicly or privately.

      (e) If the mode of voting is Private or Unrestricted, then the
          status of any votes cast privately is secret until the
          end of the voting period.

[CFJ 1124, Judged TRUE Apr. 26 1999: "Votes sent to the
 agora-discussion mailing list are neither 'sent publically' nor 'sent
 privately', and so are not valid when voting is Unrestricted."]

The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue which is not an
      Ordinary Proposal, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by
      publicly stating so. An Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

      Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
      Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
      cancelled.

Rule 955/8 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      (a) When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
          uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be
          counted by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned
          a Voting Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no
          votes against, and at least one vote for, the Voting Index
          shall be Unanimity; if there are no votes for, the Voting
          Index shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index
          shall be the number of votes for divided by the number of
          votes against.

      (b) If the Voting Index is greater than one, and greater than or
          equal to the Adoption Index for the Proposal, and if Quorum
          for the Proposal is achieved, then that Proposal is adopted.
          Otherwise, it fails.

      (c) A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except as
          described in this Rule.  A Proposal cannot be adopted except
          as described in this Rule.

Rule 1965/3 (Power=2)
Complacent Corporation

      As soon as possible after an ordinary proposal fails quorum, the
      Assessor shall publish a Notice of Complacency to that effect.
      In addition, at any time during the voting period of an ordinary
      proposal for which the number of entities eligible to vote on
      the proposal is less than the quorum of the proposal, the
      Assessor may immediately publish a Notice of Complacency without
      waiting for the proposal's voting period to end.

      Upon publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency for
      a proposal, the proposal is immediately aborted.  In addition,
      the copy of the proposal that is added to the proposal pool as a
      result of the abortion becomes democratic and distributable.

      Publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency not
      strictly authorized or required by this rule is the Class 2
      Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

Legislative Orders

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute

Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a

      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value
      of the Amendment Number of every Rule unless it is specified by
      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
      Rule and the Rule's current text.

Rule 1434/10 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used.  Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for
        collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing the results.
        The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the Referendum
        begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the results
        of the Referendum, then the Referendum fails.

      * Voters:  For the purpose of this Rule, a Voter is an entity
        permitted to Vote on a Referendum.  Only Active Players are
        Voters.  Activity is measured at the time a Vote is sent.

      * Voting: A Voter Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
        Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum
        e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.  Words which
        are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength.  No Voter may
        Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
        changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time of the
        first correct and legal public announcement that a Referendum
        has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement
        must include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.  All
        Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
        Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: At any time, the Vote Collector may
        publish a list of Voters who have Voted.  However, the Vote
        Collector shall not reveal the value of any Voter's Vote to
        anyone but that Voter, unless e has the Voter's permission to
        do so.

      * Announcement of Results: As soon as possible after the end of
        the Voting Period, the Vote Collector shall announce the
        number of Votes of each kind, as well as the name and Vote of
        each Entity that Voted. If e does not do this as soon as
        possible, then the Referendum fails.

      * Quorum: Quorum is 50% of the eligible Voters at the beginning
        of the Voting Period.  If fewer Voters Vote, then the
        Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index:  The Adoption Index of a Referendum is 1.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio of a Referendum is the
        ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST Votes.  If the Adoption Ratio is
        greater than the Adoption Index (or if both are Unanimity),
        and if the Referendum does not fail for some other reason,
        then it passes; otherwise, it fails.

      * Effectiveness: A Referendum takes effect when the Vote
        Collector correctly announces that it passes.  The effect of a
        Referendum is defined by other Rules.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: If the results of a Referendum are not
        challenged within seven days after the Vote Collector
        announces them, then the announced results are the true
        results of that Referendum, even if they would otherwise be in
        error.

Rule 1445/17 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used.  Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
        nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing
        the results.  The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time
        the Election begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the winner of
        the Election, then the Election has no winner.

      * Nominator: A Nominator is an entity permitted to Nominate a
        Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players are Nominators.
        Activity is measured at the time a Nomination is sent.

      * Prospective: A Prospective is an entity permitted to be
        Nominated as a Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players
        are Prospectives.  Activity is measured at the time a
        Nomination is sent.

      * Nominating: A Nominator Nominates a Prospective by sending a
        message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Candidates: A Candidate for an Election is a Prospective who
        has been Nominated in that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nominator may retract eir Nomination by sending
        a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Declination: A Prospective may decline eir Nomination by
        sending a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating
        Period, indicating the Election.  Upon doing so, e may not be
        re-Nominated in that Election by anyone but emself.

      * Mode of Nominations: There are three Modes of Nominations:
        Selfish, Selfless, or Open.  The Vote Collector may specify a
        Mode of Nominations when e announces the start of the
        Election; if e does not, then the Mode is Selfish.

        (a) In a Selfish Election, a Nominator may Nominate only
            emself.
        (b) In a Selfless Election, a Nominator may not Nominate
            emself.
        (c) In an Open Election, a Nominator may Nominate any
            Prospective.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the time
        of the first correct and legal announcement that an Election
        has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement
        must include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
        Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside
        of the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy:  Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * End of Nominations: As soon as possible after the end of the
        Nominating Period, the Vote Collector shall publish a list of
        all Candidates.  If e does not do this as soon as possible,
        then the Election has no winner.

      If there are no Candidates, then the Election has no winner.

      If there is exactly one Candidate, then e is the winner of that
      Election.

      If there are two or more Candidates, then a Referendum begins
      when the Vote Collector publishes the list of Candidates.  This
      is a standard Referendum, with the following exceptions:

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
        same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one Candidate for
        the given Election.  Words which are effectively synonymous
        with these are also permissible.

      * Failure of Referendum: If the Referendum fails for any reason
        (e.g. Quorum is not achieved), then the Election has no
        winner.

      * Adoption: The winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
        the most Votes were cast.  If two or more Candidates are tied
        for most Votes, then the Speaker shall choose one of those
        Candidates, who becomes the winner when the Speaker announces
        eir choice.  The Speaker shall announce eir choice as soon as
        possible after the Vote Collector announces the results of
        Voting.

      * Effectiveness: An Election takes effect when the Vote
        Collector correctly announces the identity of its winner.  The
        effect of an Election is defined by other Rules.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: If the results of an Election are not
        challenged within seven days after the Vote Collector
        announces them, then the announced results are the true
        results of that Election, even if they would otherwise be in
        error.

        case the Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the
        Election begins.

        Nomination, would not be permitted to hold the Office which
        the Election is seeking to fill.

Rule 1957/3 (Power=1)
Budgets

      A budget is a document maintained by an office which determines
      the values of various properties the office is empowered to
      determine.  An office has a budget only if the Rules explicitly
      indicate that the office has a budget.  Each budget shall be
      part of the corresponding office's Monthly Report.  As soon as
      possible after a budget changes, the holder of the corresponding
      office (the maintainer) shall publish it.

      As soon as possible after a budget is discovered to be invalid,
      its maintainer shall create a valid budget as close as possible
      to the most recent valid version of the budget.  The new budget
      shall be effective when the maintainer publishes it.

      While holding an office as electee, an officer may Without
      Objection amend the budget to adhere to a proto-budget which e
      must publish at the time e announces eir intent to amend.  The
      Rules regarding a particular budget may specify a different
      procedure for its amendment.

Rule 1958/1 (Power=1)
Nominating with Budgets

      (a) If an office has a budget, then a nomination in an election
          for that office is not valid unless a valid proto-budget is
          associated with it.

      (b) A proto-budget submitted by a nominee during the nominating
          period is associated with that nominee's nomination. A
          proto-budget is valid if it would be valid as a budget.

      (c) If a nominee for an Office fails to submit a valid
          proto-budget during the nominating period, then by default
          eir nomination is associated with a proto-budget identical
          to the current budget for that Office.  If the current
          budget is not valid, tough cookies.

      (d) When the voting period begins, the vote collector shall
          announce each candidate's last valid proto-budget.

      (e) When the voting period ends, the winner's last valid
          proto-budget becomes the budget of that office, and e shall
          announce it as soon as possible. If the election ends
          without a winner, then the existing Budget remains in
          effect.

Rule 1835/3 (Power=1)
Standing Down

      During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
      Election may stand down, by posting a public message to that
      effect. The player is then no longer to be considered a
      Candidate for that Election. Any further votes cast in eir
      favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

      Any votes cast for a Player who stands down are cancelled, and
      any Player who cast such a vote is considered to have declared
      eir Presence in that Election.  Additionally, any Player who
      cast such a vote may vote again, unless e has already cast
      another vote which remains uncancelled, and this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would prevent such a vote.

      If, at any time during the Voting Period of an Election, there
      remains only a single Candidate, the Voting Period ends
      immediately, with the sole remaining Candidate as the winner of
      that Election.  For the purposes of Rules on awarding Points,
      that Election shall not be considered a contested Election.

      the Speaker posts such a message, is not Tainted at the time of

      Speaker, the Electee of each Office on the list (assuming that
      the Office has an Electee) is retired from Office.

Rule 1626/4 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any document which has been clearly labeled as
      an Application and which has been submitted as an Application by
      some person.  That person is known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor.

      An Application is submitted by sending it to a Player designed
      by the Rules to receive Applications of that particular type,
      bearing a clear indication that the document in question is
      intended to be an Application and that it is being submitted by
      the Sponsor as an Application.  If the Rules do not otherwise
      designate a Player to receive a particular type of Application,
      the Speaker shall do so.  The effect of submitting an valid
      Application is determined by the Rules pertaining to
      Applications of that particular type.

      A person who submits an Application with signatures attached
      belonging to any person who has not consented to having eir
      signature attached to that Application commits the Class 4 Crime
      of Application Fraud.  An Application submitted with attached
      signatures belonging to a person who did not consent to such
      attachment is invalid.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

      It shall be a defense to the Crime of Application Fraud that the
      Sponsor did not receive a signatory's notice of revocation.

Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.

      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      Other Rules may establish other times by which Orders must be
      performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

Rule 1799/2 (Power=1)
Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Rule 1800/0 (Power=1)
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

Rule 1801/0 (Power=1)
Stay of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
      expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
      which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
      made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

Rule 1802/0 (Power=1)
Vacation of Orders

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

      be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

Appeal of Administrative and Private Orders

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

Rule 1810/3 (Power=1)
Noncompliance with Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.

      If an Order requires an entity to perform an action prior to a
      specified time, and the Order is not satisfied prior to that
      time specified in the Order commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Contempt by Inaction.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisfaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Selecting a Judge

      A CFJ is open if it has not been Judged, or if an outstanding
      judicial motion pertaining to it has been neither granted nor
      denied.  A CFJ is closed if it is not open.

      As soon as possible after becoming aware that an open CFJ has no
      Judge assigned to it, the Clerk of the Courts shall choose a
      Player eligible to Judge it, and announce them as its Trial
      Judge.  That Player remains the Trial Judge of that CFJ until e
      is recused from it or becomes ineligible to Judge it.

      (a) Each active player is eligible to judge a given CFJ, unless

          are ineligible to judge CFJs.

      (b) If the Clerk of the Courts is required to select a Judge,
          but after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
          account, no player is eligible to judge that CFJ, then:

          (1) All active non-barred players become eligible to judge
              that CFJ.

              active barred players, other than the caller emself,
              become eligible to judge that CFJ.
          (3) If there is still no eligible Judge, then the game is in
              serious trouble. My usual advice in such situations is
              to panic, and run screaming for the hills.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over other Rules concerning who
          is and is not eligible to judge CFJs.

Rule 2025/1 (Power=1)
Transfer of Jurisdiction

      (a) A CFJ (the First Case) is transferred to the Judge of
          another CFJ (the Second Case), if all of the following are
          true:

          (1) the Second Judge is eligible to Judge the First Case (or
              is ineligible solely due to the Rule "Turns for All");
          (2) the First Judge announces the transfer; and
          (3) the Second Judge consents to the transfer within a week
              after it is announced.

      (b) When the First Case is transferred in this way:

          (1) the First Case is assigned to the Second Judge, and
              ceases to be assigned to the First Judge;
          (2) the First Judge becomes eligible to Judge CFJs for the
              purposes of the Rule "Turns for All"; and
          (3) the First CFJ becomes Linked to the Second CFJ, and to
              any CFJs to which the Second CFJ had been Linked. It
              ceases to be Linked to any other CFJs.

Rule 408/15 (Power=1)
Late Judgement

      For each Judge assigned to a CFJ, eir Deliberation Period begins
      when the Clerk of the Courts announces eir assignment, and lasts
      seven days; eir Overtime Period begins when eir Deliberation
      Period ends, and lasts seven days.

      A Judge who Judges a CFJ during eir Overtime Period commits the
      Class 0.5 Infraction of Judging a Bit Late, to be reported by
      the Clerk of the Courts.

      During a Judge's Overtime Period, if e has not yet Judged the
      CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts may recuse the Judge by
      announcing that e does so.  At the end of a Judge's Overtime
      Period, if e has not yet Judged the CFJ, then e is automatically
      recused.

      A Judge recused according to this Rule commits the Class 3
      Infraction of Failure to Judge, to be reported by the Clerk of
      the Courts.  E becomes ineligible to Judge any CFJ for one
      month, or until e publicly requests to become eligible again,
      whichever is soonest.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

[CFJ 684: An Injunction on the interpretation of a Rule is part of
 Game Custom.
 CFJ 897: The requirements in Rule 217 on Judgements apply to the
 determinations of the members of a Board of Appeal, as well as to
 the Judgements of Judges.
 CFJ 1139, Judged Jun. 20 1999: Judgements need not necessarily accord
 with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or Justices given in
 past CFJs.
 CFJ 1219, Judged May 23, 2000, Appeal decision published, Jun. 13
 2000: A mistaken Judgement (ie one that does not accord with the
 Rules) is still a Judgement, as long as the technical requirements on

      clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

Rule 1827/5 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
      when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, e
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Slow Motion, which may be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts. If this occurs, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one as
      usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
      Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

Rule 789/5 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate Rules

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated.  The Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate
      a Rule Without Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be
      modified in any way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

 also in the everyday interpretation of the Rule.]

      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      if the SLC ceases to exist; if required to do so by a valid

Rule 1742/3 (Power=1)
Agreements between Players

      Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
      that such agreements will be binding under the rules.  If such
      an agreement is subsequently broken, any player party to that
      agreement may then call a CFJ alleging that the agreement has
      been broken.  If the judge of such a CFJ finds that the
      agreement was entered into with the intention that the agreement
      be binding under the rules, and that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, then e may order the breaching party to perform
      according to the agreement, or perform substitute acts that
      would fairly serve the interests of the agreement; e may further
      order the other parties of the agreement to perform such acts as
      may be necessary to preserve fairness and justice.

      Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate

Rule 1365/8 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application to
      Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has the
      effect of annotating a Judgement in a given Call for Judgement.
      In order for such an Application to have effect upon submission,
      it must satisfy the following requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement to which it applies is
        that of the Judge or that of the Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be submitted no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement to which it applies, and no later than one week
        after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of that
        Judgement.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having been
      submitted and having met all the requirements for effectiveness,
      is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred to as a
      Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the
      Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement.

Rule 911/11 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected to reach a decision about the subject of the Appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three Appelate Judges.  Any Judge
      assigned according to this Rule is an Appelate Judge.

      A Board of Appeals is selected when the Clerk of the Courts
      correctly announces the identity of all Appelate Judges,
      determined as follows:

        a) The Speaker is selected, if eligible.
        b) The Clerk of the Courts is selected, if eligible.
        c) The Justiciar is selected, if eligible.
        d) Any remaining positions are filled by random selection by
           the Clerk of the Courts from all remaining eligible
           Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected for that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed from that Board.
      iii) E has been Trial Judge of the subject of the Appeal.
       iv) E is ineligible to Judge the CFJ at the time of selection.
        v) E is not Active.

      An Appelate Judge may appoint another eligible Player as eir
      replacement by informing the Clerk of the Courts, provided the
      Player consents.

      As soon as possible after an Appelate Judge is recused, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select an eligible Player to
      replace em.

      The last Appelate Judge selected is the Lead Judge for that
      Board.  If the Lead Judge is replaced, then the replacement
      becomes Lead Judge.

Rule 1693/2 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If a Judgement of TRUE or FALSE is Appealed, the Board of
      Appeals shall consider the correctness of that Judgement.

      If a Judgement of DISMISSED is Appealed, the Board shall not
      consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they shall
      only consider whether a Judgement of DISMISSED should have been
      delivered.

      For an Appelate Judge assigned to the Appeal of a Judgement, a
      Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN, REVERSE,
      REASSIGN, or REMAND.

      When a Judgement is overturned:

        a) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REVERSE, then
           the CFJ shall be treated as if it were Judged normally,
           with the Judgement being that which a majority of the
           Appelate Judges agree on.

        b) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REASSIGN, then
           the original Judgement is ignored, the original Judge is
           recused, and the Clerk of the Courts shall reassign the CFJ
           to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was originally
           assigned.  The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement as
           the original Judge for the same reason.

        c) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REMAND, then the
           original Judgement shall be ignored, and the Clerk of the
           Courts shall reassign the CFJ to the original Judge as if
           it were being originally assigned. The Judge may not make
           the same Judgement for the same reason.

        d) If none of the above is true, then the CFJ shall be
           reassigned as described above.

      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.

      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

Formal Apologies

      If a Player (hereafter the Ninny) is convicted of a Crime, then
      instead of executing Sentencing Orders, the Judge may (Without
      Objection) Order the Ninny to publish a Formal Apology.  Such an

      A Formal Apology must be at least 200 words, and must explain
      the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for
      self-improvement.  Furthermore, the Order to Apologize may
      include up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's choice, all of
      which must appear in the Formal Apology.

      Failure to obey an Order to Apologize within 72 hours is the

Rule 1812/6 (Power=1)
Notices of Infraction

      If an entity (hereafter the Jaywalker) commits an Infraction,
      then any Player authorized by the Rules to report the commission
      of that Infraction (hereafter the Traffic Cop) may publish a
      Notice of Infraction.  This Notice shall explicitly specify the
      following:

        a) The Infraction that has been committed.
        b) The identity of the Jaywalker.
        c) The Rule(s) defining that action or inaction as an
           Infraction.
        d) The action or inaction by which the Jaywalker committed the
           Infraction.
        e) All and only those Ticketing Orders necessary and
           sufficient to impose the penalty for that Infraction.  The
           Orders are executed and take effect upon publication.

      When a Player publishes a Claim of Error alleging that the
      Jaywalker did not commit the Infraction, e may (in the same
      message as the COE) stay one or more of the Ticketing Orders.
      If the COE is denied, then the Traffic Cop shall vacate the
      Order to Stay as soon as possible. If the COE is admitted, then
      the Traffic Cop shall vacate all the stayed Ticketing Orders as
      soon as possible.

      Players are encouraged to CFJ on the commission of Infractions
      only when a question of interpretation, rather than of fact,
      arises.

[CFJ 1391: Only one valid Notice of Infraction may be announced for a
 single given commission of an Infraction.]

      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action

      Crime through a given action or inaction, then any further CFJ
      alleging that the same Player has committed the same Crime
      through the same action or inaction lacks standing and shall be

Rule 1505/10 (Power=1)
Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions

      A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
      Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots.  Such a penalty is
      assessed upon the execution of a Ticketing Order that Orders the
      Herald to record the penalty.

      A Class N Crime (where N is replaced with a number) is a Crime
      for which the penalty is N Blots and a loss of 2*N Points.  Such
      a penalty is assessed upon the execution of a Sentencing Order
      that Orders the Herald to record the penalty, and a Notice of
      Award of the Points penalty.

      If such a Sentencing or Ticketing Order is vacated after the
      Herald has already recorded the penalty, then an equal number of
      Blots are expunged from the penalized entity.  (If the entity
      has less Blots than the amount of the penalty, then all eir
      Blots are expunged.)  In the case of a vacated Sentencing Order,
      the lost Points are to be Awarded back to the penalized entity,
      provided that the game has not been Won between the execution of

Rule 1681/5 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

      effect.  Other Rules may require additional information to
      appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

Kudos

      Kudos (singular Kudo) are an integral measure of a Player's
      Kismet and noteworthiness within the game of Agora.

      The Herald is the recordkeepor of Kudos.  The kudos of a Player
      may only be changed as specified by the rules or by an
      instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      Agora, as a whole, also has a defined number of Kudos.  No other
      non-Player entity has a defined number of Kudos.

      If an entity has a defined number of Kudos, but the number has
      not been set by the Rules, then the entity has 1 Kudo.

Rule 1941/2 (Power=1)
Fees

      If the Rules associate a non-negative cost, price, charge, or
      fee with an action, that action is a fee-based action.  If the
      specified cost is not an integer, the actual fee is the next
      highest integer.

      To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
      is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
      that action.  Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
      are increased by the fee.

      Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
      Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
      action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
      attempted action.

      As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
      confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
      greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.  If the
      Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor of the
      Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
      shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
      (and Agora) shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.

      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the

Cards
  This Category includes Rules regulating Cards.

Rule 2068/0 (Power=1)
The Deckmastor

      The Deckmastor is an office which acts as the recordkeepor for
      Cards. The Deckmastor's Weekly Report shall contain a record of
      all Cards in existence and what entity possesses each Card.

      The Deckmastor shall have a budget containing the Maximum Hand
      Size, which is a positive integer between 3 and 10. In the
      absence of a budget, the Maximum Hand Size shall be 5.

      The Deck is a Gambler. The Deckmastor shall be the sole Executor
      of The Deck, but may take no action on behalf of The Deck except
      as explicitly permitted by the Rules. The Deck may not transfer
      Cards to any other entity except as explicitly required by the
      Rules.

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and e may do if
      and only if the Rules require it by announcing the Card being
      created or destroyed and the entity who either possesses it now
      or possessed it at the time of destruction as appropriate.

History:
Created by Proposal 4573 (Wes), 14 May 2004

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2069/0 (Power=1)
Card Definitions

      I. Possession

      Cards may be possessed by Gamblers. All Players are Gamblers.
      If at any time a Card is not possessed by a Gambler, it
      immediately and automatically returns to the possession of The
      Deck.

      The Gambler that possesses a Card is that Card's Holder and
      Holds that Card. All Cards possessed by a particular Gambler are
      collectively referred to as that Gambler's Hand. A Gambler's
      Hand Size is the number of Cards in eir Hand plus one for each
      Pending Draw for that Gambler.

      II. Definitions

      The Rules may define a Class of Card by specifying a Caption, a
      Quota, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits. All
      Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible. Each
      individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a Copy
      of that Class of Card.

      (a) The Caption shall be the name of a particular Class of
          Cards. No two Classes of Cards shall have the same Caption.

      (b) The Quota shall be a non-negative integer. If at any time
          fewer Copies of a Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then
          the Deckmastor shall create a Copy of that Card in the
          possession of The Deck. If at any time more Copies of a
          Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then the Deckmastor
          shall destroy a Copy of that Card in the possession of The
          Deck, unless no such Copies exist, in which case the
          Deckmastor shall destroy a random Copy.

      (c) The Rules may define Elements for Cards. Each Element shall
          have a name and a description. Any Card possessing the
          Element of that name shall behave according to the
          description associated with that Element. An Element not
          defined in the Rules has no effect.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
          pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
          that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
          as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule says otherwise, a Card is
          automatically transferred to The Deck immediately after
          being Played.

      III. Actions

      No action involving Cards may be simultaneous with any other
      action. No such action may be performed more than once
      simultaneously. If any attempt is made to perform more than one
      such action in such a way that the order of said actions is
      unclear, all such actions fail.

      (a) Unless restricted from doing so by the rules, any Gambler
          possessing a Card may transfer that Card to any other
          Gambler by announcing which Card is to be transferred and
          the Gambler it shall be transferred to. All such transfers
          take place at the time they are announced.

          Discarding a Card is synonymous with transfering said Card
          to The Deck.

      (b) Drawing a Card and Drawing from The Deck are synonymous.

          When a Gambler Draws a Card, the Deckmastor shall be
          required to randomly select one Card from among those
          currently in The Deck's Hand and transfer it to that Gambler
          as soon as possible. Until this transfer takes place, that
          Gambler is said to have one Pending Draw for each such
          transfer the Deckmastor is required to make, but has not yet
          made.

          A Gambler may Draw from The Deck for a Fee equal to the
          number of times that Gambler has previously Drawn from the
          Deck during the current month so long as the Gambler's Hand
          Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/15 (Power=1)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
      distinction.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person
      is said to Bear that Patent Title; the Patent Title is Borne
      by the person, and the person is its Bearor.  When a Patent
      Title is revoked from a person, that person ceases to Bear that
      Patent Title.  The status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be
      changed as explicitly set out in the Rules. Only persons may
      Bear Patent Titles.

      As soon as possible after a Patent Title award or revocation
      which occurs automatically occurs, the Herald shall publicly
      announce that such an award or revocation has occurred, and
      which Title has been awarded to or revoked from which person or
      persons.

      Significance is a stuck switch for Patent Titles with states
      Historical, Hysterical, and Ephemeral.  The Herald may, Without
      Objection, cause a Title be switched from Historical
      Significance to Hysterical Significance.

Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  Quack, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the production,
           distribution, and marketing of panaceas and other patent
           medicines.

      (c)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for one Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as 1, with 2 Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with 3 Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus 2 Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (d)  Filthy Bureaucrat, to be awarded to any player who at some
           point simultaneously holds and is Electee to three or more
           Offices. This Patent Title is revoked from a player who
           ceases to hold and be Electee to three or more Offices.

      (e)  Admiral, to be awarded to a Team Captain when eir Team
           achieves a Team Win.

      Defining something to be a 'boon' or an 'albatross' is
      equivalent to defining it to be an ephemeral Patent Title with
      its Karma set as defined.

      Players may be permitted or required by the Rules to award or
      revoke Boons or Albatrosses.  If so, these awards are performed
      by public announcement by the specified Players.

      A Player may hold multiple instances of a given type of
      ephemeral Patent title; if so, The Herald need only note the
      number of instances of these Patent Titles that each player
      holds.

Degrees

      for any official or unofficial business if and only if e
      currently Bears that Degree.

      Persons may come to Bear Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person Bears a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default
      properties of Patent Titles.

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A

Rule 1370/13 (Power=1)
How to Get a Degree

     A person becomes a Candidate for a Degree when e publishes a
     Thesis Draft, authored by emself, along with a statement
     explicitly indicating that the Thesis Draft is being submitted
     with the intent to qualify for a particular degree.

     If the Candidate is a Player, e may choose another Player to be
     the first member of eir Thesis Committee, called eir Chair, with
     the Chair's consent.  For non-players, or if no other Player
     consents to be the Chair within one month of draft submission,
     the Speaker will serve as Chair.

     If the Speaker is neither the Chair nor the Candidate, the
     Speaker shall appoint a Player who is neither the Chair nor the
     Candidate to be the second Committee member.  Otherwise, the
     Justiciar shall so appoint, unless the Chair or the Candidate is
     the Justiciar, in which case the Clerk of the Courts shall so
     appoint.  The two Committee members shall then select, by mutual
     consent, a third person who is not the Candidate to be the third
     Committee member.

     The Committee shall examine the Candidate and eir Thesis to
     determine eir qualifications for the Degree.  The Candidate may
     publish a new Thesis Draft at any time, in response to Committee
     requests or of eir own choosing, by indicating it is a new Thesis
     Draft for the same Degree.

     If the Committee is dissolved without granting a degree, the
     Committee ceases to be a Committee, and the Candidate ceases to
     be a Candidate, and any existant Thesis Draft must be republished
     and subject to a new Committee selection to be eligible for a
     Degree.

     The Chair of a Thesis Committee may dissolve the Committee
     without granting a degree, with the consent of at least one other
     Committee member.  To so dissolve, the Chair must publish a
     notice of intent to dissolve at least 14 days before dissolving.
     The Candidate may so dissolve the Committee at any time by public
     announcement.

     The Chair of the Thesis Committee for a particular Candidate may
     award that Degree to the Candidate if and only if:

      * the Candidate has satisfied all prerequisites in the rules for
        the award of that Degree;
      * a majority of members of the Thesis Committee agree that the
        most recent Thesis draft produced by the Candidate is worthy
        of the Degree to be granted; and
      * fewer than seven years have passed since that Committee was
        formed.

      Each Committee Member may have up to 14 days after a Degree is
      awarded to publish a Commentary for the Thesis.  After that
      time, the Chair shall publish the most recent Thesis Draft along
      with all Commentary so published.  This combined publication
      shall become the Final Thesis.  Upon publication of this Final
      Thesis the Committee members cease to be Committee members for
      that Thesis.

      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Final Thesis.

Rule 2013/1 (Power=1)
Champion's Contests

      If no Champion's Contest exists, the Scorekeepor or the Speaker
      may, with 2 Support, name an existing Contest to be a Champion's
      Contest.  The namers are encouraged to select Contests that they
      feel would give the maximum enjoyment to Agorans as a whole, and
      give preference to Contests run by Players who were members of
      the most recently winning team.

      The Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest ceases to be a member
      of any team, rules to the contrary nonwithstanding.  If e ceases
      to be Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest, e shall be assigned
      to a team as if e were a new Player.

      Each Champion's Contest begins with zero awardable points, as
      tracked by the Scorekeepor.  At the beginning of each month, the
      Contest's awardable points are increased by the Champion's Grant
      contained in the Scorekeepor's Budget.

      A Champion's Contest Contestmaster may publish a Notice of
      Award, listing a positive number of Points to be awarded to a
      team or teams.  The posting must obey all regulations for such
      posting contained in the Contest's SLC, and award no more than
      the Contest's awardable points, to be valid.

      The effect of a valid Notice of Award is to increase the named
      teams' points as indicated, and decrease the Contest's awardable
      points by the same amount.

      When a Team Win occurs, any Champion's Contest ceases to be a
      Champion's Contest and loses all awardable points.

Rule 2055/3 (Power=1)
The Scorekeepor's Budget

      The Scorekeepor's Budget shall contain the following:

        a) The Team Points Goal, a positive integer.
        b) The Champion's Grant, a positive integer.
        c) One or more scoring events, each with the following

Rule 1929/7 (Power=1)
Points

      A Player's Score is a measure of that Player's unloserliness,
      measured in Points. The Score of each Player is at all times an
      integer. A Player who has not been Awarded or Penalized since
      the last Team Win has a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first valid notification for that specific
            event

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is invalid and points do not change.

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the player may be penalized/awarded a number of
      points equal to the original award/penalty.

      The Herald's Budget shall consist of a positive integer between
      5 and 25, known as the Tabla Rasa.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each quarter, the
      Herald shall announce the Turning of a New Parchment.

      The effect of such an announcement is to:
      (A) set each Player's kudos equal to:
          (i)    the Tabla Rasa;
          (ii)   plus the number of boons e holds;

          the current number of Players;

      (C) revoke all ephemeral Patent Titles.

Blots

      A entity's Stain is a measure of that entity's cleanliness,

      non-negative number.

      If the Rules state that an entity gains, is assessed, or is
      penalised some number of Blots, then, as soon as possible after
      the Herald is informed of the change, e shall record an increase
      of that amount in the entity's Stain.  (If the entity was an
      Unready Player at the time of the change, then the Herald shall
      instead record an increase of half that amount.)

      If the Rules state that some number of a entity's Blots are
      expunged, then, as soon as possible after the Herald is informed
      of the change, e shall record a decrease of that amount in the
      entity's Stain.  (If this would result in a negative Stain, then
      it instead results in a Stain of zero.)

Rule 1714/8 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      A Lawless Player is a Player with more than 20 Blots.

      Any Player may at any time publicly allege that another Player
      is Lawless.  If the allegation is incorrect, the Player who made
      the allegation commits the Class 15 Crime of Persecution.
      Otherwise, the following events occur in order:

        (i)  if the Lawless Player is the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
             immediately becomes Speaker, and the Lawless Player
             ceases to be Speaker;

       (ii)  the Lawless Player is removed from any Offices e holds;
             and

      (iii)  the Lawless Player is deregistered.

      If a Player is deregistered according to the provisions of this
      Rule, e may not register again until a month has passed from eir
      deregistration.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered.

[CFJ 1059: Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
 Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit declaration that
 a particular Player is Lawless.]

Rule 1747/7 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Fugitives from
      Justice that have been deregistered for Lawlessness.  The Clerk
      may not exercise this power more than once per Agoran month, and
      may not Pardon the same person twice in a given term of Office
      (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon that person).
      The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Fugitive from Justice by
      publicly announcing e is doing so. Then the following events
      shall occur:

         i) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the
            Fugitive's Blots as required to reduce eir Stain to one
            less than the threshold for Lawlessness, and notify the
            Herald of this action.

        ii) After the above step has been completed, the Fugitive may
            reregister as a Player.

       iii) The Pardoned Player shall then publish a Formal Apology
            for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to
            ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        iv) For three months after being Pardoned, the Pardoned Player
            may not perform any Progressive Actions except expunging
            Blots from eir record, unless e is Immaculate.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      or when a deregistered Player may reregister.

Rule 1647/11 (Power=1)
The Speaker-Elect

      The Speaker-Elect is an office; its holder is usually the
      Speaker's successor.

      Whenever the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be
      Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker can never hold the Office of
      Speaker-Elect, nor be the Electee to the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.  If the Speaker somehow becomes the Electee to
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, e is immediately removed from that
      Office.

      The Clerk of the Courts, Justiciar and Assistant Director of
      Personnel cannot be Nominated for the Office of Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect has no Electee, because of the
      Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker (or for any other reason), the
      Office is filled according to the Order of Succession, as
      defined by other Rules.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

      such.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is

      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

Rule 402/10 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition commences,
      the Assistant Director of Personnel shall publish a Notice of
      Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the Transition
      and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect at the time
      the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under

Rule 1595/0 (Power=1)
Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

Rule 1590/2 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      SLC between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

[CFJ 860: It is sufficient for the Rules to name an Officer as
 Maintainer of an SLC.]

Rule 2053/1 (Power=1)
Team Points, Team Scores

      A Team Score is at all times an integer.  The Team Score of a
      Team is the total sum of all Points of all Players grouped into
      that Team, plus the Team's Team Points.

      A Team who has not been Awarded or Penalized since the last Team
      Win has zero Team Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Team to be Awarded or Penalised Team Points. If said event
      occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the Award
      or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in the
      affected Team Points.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
      -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
      -- It must unambiguously describe the event
      -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
      -- It must be the first valid notification for that specific
         event

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is invalid and points do not change.

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the team may be penalized/awarded a number of points
      equal to the original award/penalty.

      as soon as possible after the Team Win is achieved.  In the
      announcement the Scorekeepor shall award the Boon of Teamwork to
      each Player in the winning Team.

      Later in the same announcement the Scorekeepor shall reassign
      the grouping of Players into Teams as follows;
